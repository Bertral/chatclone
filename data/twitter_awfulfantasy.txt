The mysterious man flung back the hood that had previously covered his face. The hearth's flame flickered as if in response, causing the stranger's shadow to dance angrily against the door behind him‚Äîthe only way out. At one point a shadow looked like a bunny rabbit hopping lol.

Aragorn handed Frodo a giant turkey leg from the Shire County Fair food tent.
"Why do you look so disappointed, Master Baggins?"
Frodo looked at his food. "I don't think this is a very good Festival Turkey Leg. If it were, I should think it would look fairer and feel fowler."

Sobbing, Peter handed over his infant son to Glibjolb the Interstellar Dominator, Son of Mehrab the Painful.
"Just take him! If it means no one else on Earth shall die!"
"What do you say to the nice man, Glibjolb? scolded Mehrab."
"Glorrrrp youuuu," intoned Glibjolb reluctantly.

@MrZoeyRoss @Fearless_Fred @DaveScheidt No idea... Fixed it!

"I don't know if I am free on the morrow, young squire," John said to the intern. "Let me gaze through the looking glass into the world of CALENDAR!" John pulled out his phone and thumbed through his apps. Everyone in the board room was looking at him like he was fuckin' crazy.

Nitro woke to the sound of laser cars whirring past her apartment window. "Might as well get up," she muttered as she headed to the laser coffee maker. Using her laser scissors, she opened a new bag of laser ground coffee and‚Äîdid I mention this is the future? Well, it is.

"He's devious," said Alam. "I heard tale the man cuts out both his victim's eyes and makes them watch as he feeds them to his dogs."
"How do they watch?" asked Reddy.
"Eh?"
"How do they watch if they ain't got eyes?"
"Eh?"
To Reddy's horror, he saw Alam's ears had been cut off.

"My name is Alodrus and I'm addicted to white magic," Alodrus told the room.
"Hello Alodrus," everyone replied.
"I once let another wizard practice the brown arts all over my chest to get enough mana to heal myself until I passed out," he sobbed.

XZomrikka beings Hjj and Zu continued to reminisce.
"Remember when we were but merely jchlinglies?!" chortled Hjj as his memory glands spurted nostalgia fluid on the floor. The waiter slipped in it and fondly remembered slipping as a child at his family's cabin on Europa.

The evil sorcerer kept casting Flaming Parakeet at everything in town. The townsfolk's homes caught aflame, sure, but the sound of the parakeets screaming in terror and agony had the real lasting effects.

"Gandalf..."
"Gandalf? Yes... that is what they used to call me. Gandalf the Grey. I am Gandalf the ùêñùê°ùê¢ùê≠ùêû."
"I didn't say Grey."
"It sounded like you were about to say Grey. That's why I was confused."
"So what should we call you?"
"Gandalf is fine."

@PFTompkins I appreciate it!

"...and this is the stableboy of Cryptocurenncia Castle," introduced Lord Varna.
"Oh, he's big! What's your name, young man?" asked the visiting Lord.
"HODL!" replied Hodl.
"Interesting name, what's it mean?"
Lord Varna shrugged. "Fuck if I know. He's not the smartest."

"The Goblin army advances! Prepare yourselves!" shouted the general to her archers.
Luckily for her, the enemy was made up entirely of goblin millennials. They just stared at their phones the whole time and complained about the heat until they shambled into arrow range.

Upon peering at the Box of the Revenant, Dr. Kim's face started melting off. If his face could talk, it might have said, "I'm so weary of being elastic. It's time I became a liquid, I think." However, it wasn't his face's idea to melt off, so that'd be an odd thing for it to say.

He approached his target in the dark while making no noise, like a legless cricket. Also like a legless cricket, he was unable to attract a mate.

Erdaor's numchuck skills were undeniable. Orc after orc fell to mighty numchuck blows. The numchucks were a blur of shimmering death. His travel companion, Numb Chuck, couldn't believe his eyes.

King Solomon was against war so much that is subjects would never consider him bloodthirsty. They were much more likely to call him waterthirsty or foodhungry or sleeptired.

@CaptainOfBeard @TenzanTR They're we go! Your getting it!

Honest mistake. And quite frankly, its downright embarrassing. https://t.co/RRrCn8vGpK

The Space General pointed to the battle map and detailed the mission with the precision of scientific space directions. ‚ÄúWe will strike here. Just to the upside-down and upward leftish of Planet Blagh, which is  righty-tighty turny-lurny and 80¬∞ un-westish of it‚Äôs third moon.‚Äù

@Keyblader007 @iAmFiatcha https://t.co/0UGFFpQF5T

Each night, two hours after sunset, Nigel Plaskit would drink heartily and regale guests of the Mangy Badger Inn with tales of adventure. And three hours after sunset he would pass out, allowing the bar‚Äôs patrons to take what they wanted from his many pockets, bags, and satchels.

You are there‚Ä¶ Guess who's in the grave? https://t.co/7QzRqKmM1y

He stood at the grave which was right under the shade of a huge whopper of a goddamned tree. He was crying, which isn‚Äôt even remotely dumb. Crying is a normal part of life, dweeb-dick. Though, the sunset he was looking at was pure fucking shit.

One of Igam the Ravager's more sinister implements was what he called the "Slide of Viscera." It was just like Crocodile Mile, except instead of water it was coated in blood. Victims would run, then slide, hit the bump and take a dive ‚Äì into more blood. Then they'd be murdered.

@musicalmuchacho Hessa is 1/8th Dragon.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never escape my Time Prison!‚Äù laughed the evil Grandpa Klok as Hessa barely made a 9:30 appointment. ‚ÄúAnd since your car is running on empty, you‚Äôd better find the time to get gas before heading to the grocery store after work tomorrow!‚Äù

@pattonoswalt Good question.

"Never travel far without a rope!" said the elf as he finished tying the noose.

Professor Feathermane, the Human-sized Scientist Rooster Soldier, tossed a 400 Gigawatt Nuclear Grenade into enemy lines and ducked behind a dilapidated Hydro Tank for cover.
The flash was as bright as a thousand suns.
‚ÄúCock-a-doodle-doo, cyborg scum,‚Äù Feathermane clucked.

In one fluid motion, Tezza's sword split the alien down its middle. Gaseous alien blood steamed out like an intergalactic tea pot.
‚ÄúTea‚Äôs ready,‚Äù she said to herself and then chuckled. Now she wanted tea. ‚ÄúI wish tea was ready,‚Äù she whispered.
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù said the alien as it died.

An immense portal opened and the mutant armies spilled out like some sort of mutant-army-flavored pasta sauce, slowly covering that hot plate of spaghetti that simple folks like us call Earth.

The man standing next to the King was wearing all white. His mustache and beard were white as well. Everything about him was as white as a peeled potato. His eyebrows were as brown as a boiled potato that wasn‚Äôt peeled. He was also holding a potato.

"A raven from the town of Intyrnet, m'lord."

"Let me see that." The king opened the letter.

Scientist Rick Pienti lives a relatively normal life‚Ä¶ that is, until the day he  invents a working time machine! But when Rick passes out from the  g-force of his maiden voyage, he's sent barreling through space-time completely unconscious in "PAST-OUT". In book stores Jan 1.

The evil Hangman threw his deadly noose at the heroes. They dodged deftly. "Sorry, Hangman," Jellena said as she readied her axe, "but all your efforts have been for knot."

"The first draft is long and full of errors," warned the well-read woman.

"Captain, the atmosphere on this strange new planet is 100% helium!"
The crew jumped outside in unrestrained glee to fill their balloons, forgetting their spacesuits. They died slowly, suffocating between hilariously high-pitched gasps for breath and squeaky screams of terror.

"I'm from the future," he told Ted. "I was sent back to study human rage by slightly spoiling popular TV show story arcs with subtle remarks."
"The future is sad," said Ted.
"Yes, much like how I felt about what happens to Eli in the very popular show Alien Quest next season."

@Heslin They backed our custom author card pledge tier in our Kickstarter for Awful Fantasy: The Card Game. They got to be authors in the game.

@DrDanyo Sorry to hear. Hopefully the new game gets to you quickly!

The cosmic being slumbered in a separate reality. A deity so horrifically unfathomable, merely contemplating its fart would drive you mad.

@danooli_dani @EpicNerdCamp Awesome!

@otakukeith We said "Tall as she was beautiful." Which means that she wasn't beautiful.

@danooli_dani Hello Dani, discard piles are face up.

@GrowGiant Ooo! A Jumping Shark! Thanks for the enemy idea!

The necromancer's undead army was a macabre sight. The only respite to the horror was the xylophone sound the skeletons made as they walked.

The Trolls of Muth'rs Baysmint Cave spoke oddly.
"LEL. U mad tho?" asked the first Troll.
"Nah. lmao what a nub," retorted his companion.

"Forget everything you think you know," she said, "and if you think you know how to forget everything you think you know, forget it."

"They call you a beast, but I think I love you," breathed Belle.
"Listen, you're just not my type. You've got sharp knees," said the Beast.

"Gods, who is that?!"
"Who Kilmey? He's the mutant stableboy from my castle. All he can say is his name. Cool, huh?"
"Kill me," said Kilmey.

It will please you to know that Ser Ronnas died peacefully last night, immediately after being violently ripped in half by a dragon.

K'etha did it. She was riding a wyvern! The experience was just like playing the authors app, Flappy Wyvern, available on the mobile store.

His plans ruined, the evil Ass-faced Alien readied his attack. "You heroes are a huge pain in my face!" he sharted at the top of his lungs.

"What a beautiful garden. I'm Adam, what's your name?"
"Eve... Who's your friend?"
"I'm the Terminator. Come with me if you want to live."

Ed scooped up the discarded bills.
"Money's been useless since the nuclear apocalypse, Ed."
Ed sighed. "Student loan payment is due."

Aragorn saw birds in the distance.
"It's Saruman! We're being 'wire-tapped!' This is McCarthyism!" he shouted, diving under a nearby shrub.

"My Lord, we need to dig a moat before the coming siege."
"No!" screamed Lord Vernon. "The RealmOwners Association says it'd hurt resale!"

Gar was obviously a seasoned pit fighter. His scarred body was testament to that. He also didn't care that his beef whistle was hanging out.

The alien burst from Dan's stomach. Spaghetti sauce or blood spattered the wall. It was probably blood. Either way, it would stain.

King Cupcake had returned to the Candy Castle but its chocolate halls and gumdrop ballrooms were empty. The entire place had been desserted.

"Captain! The Ship's Defense Shield isn't initiating!"
"What drivers are we using?"
"53.5."
"Ah. Should be 6‚Äî"
They all died a fiery death.

"She shouted in pain and her voice echoed all over the torture chamber because there was hardly any furniture in there to absorb the sound."

Toby the hacker cat stared at the screen. His thoughts warred between saving the world and fighting the urge to walk all over the keyboard.

We're glad some of you like our choose-your-own-awful-adventure so far. We'll be continuing this awful story on @AwfulAdventures.

He seems trustworthy, but you‚Äôre not sure you should go with him. I mean, you‚Äôve been doing soooo good on your own.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm from the future. I‚Äôm here to save you and your entire world. Come with me or you‚Äôll die,‚Äù he tells you. ‚ÄúAlso, I‚Äôm not a Terminator.‚Äù

...a man holding a mysterious weapon! His medium-length brown hair tumbles about his ears. His square face is stern. He looks dangerous.

ZORP! The Demon Chef explodes into a million pieces! You fall to the floor with a PLORP! Through the flying demon/bone fragments, you see...

‚ÄúWhy me?!‚Äù you weep.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! I‚Äôll serve your head paste as an appetizer,‚Äù the Chef announces. Then, something amazing happens.

You sob harder. ‚ÄúJesus, this is pathetic,‚Äù the Chef groans. ‚ÄúIf you keep crying, then I‚Äôm going to smash your head into head paste.‚Äù

"I saw the new moon late yestreen, Wi' the auld moon in her arm," he says. He waits for your answer.

‚ÄúA...a...riddle?‚Äù you ask, sniffling. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right,‚Äù says the Chef as he pulls you close to his nightmarish skull face.

‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt be like that,‚Äù says The Demon Chef, ‚ÄúTell you what, I‚Äôll give you a riddle, and if you get it right, I won‚Äôt cook you.‚Äù

He holds you upside down over the bubbling concoction and you beg a ton. It‚Äôs really quite pathetic and awkward for everyone.

Suddenly, the Demon Chef has you in his bony grip! "I don‚Äôt wanna die!" you sob as he takes you to a huge pot full of boiling corpse stew.

You try to sneak but you accidentally trip over some T-Fal¬Æ. Of course, this alerts the Skeletal Demon Chef, but you knew that would happen.

@mattrainis Some people just want to watch the world burn.

You begin sneaking to the tunnel but Jesus Christ don‚Äôt let that Skeletal Demon Chef hear you!

You think you can make it to the tunnel by sneaking along the back wall. You know that you'll DEFINITELY DIE if the Chef hears you.

The Demon Chef is busy cooking people and doesn‚Äôt notice you yet, so you may be perfectly safe as long as you don‚Äôt make any noise.

At the far end of the kitchen you see a torchlit stone tunnel. Above the entrance is a sign that reads ‚ÄòTo Water Storage‚Äô. How convenient!

You enter the kitchen and see that the smell was actually just Indian food. But there‚Äôs also a Skeletal Demon Chef cooking like 50 corpses.

You halt before the kitchen door as smells worse than death waft out from within. Maybe it's just Indian food?

The smell of death is strong as you step over bodies. You hear screams from somewhere in the castle. More on that later if you don't die.

With your dead servant on the floor and water on your mind, you decide to head to the kitchen to get a drink yourself.

Since it took 24 hours for you to decide what to say, Kris has died a lonely death. ‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt you speak?!‚Äù you remember him screaming.

@matgutting Yes, all choices pertain to you.

Kris, your old servant, emerges from behind a castle thing with an arrow in his back. "Help...attacked..." he gasps.

Entering through the door, you see a large hall lined with tapestries and other castle stuff. It's quiet and eerie, like a haunted library.

You walk around the castle to the rarely-used side door. Strangely, it's unlocked and the screen door has been propped open. Rash hisses.

You call to the Gatekeep to tell him you're going to find another way in. There's no response (because he's dead but you don't know that).

Rash, your cat, purrs as you scratch behind her ears.

@Brockway_LLC This is definitely going to be a thing!

You arrive back at your Lord's castle after being exiled 2 hours ago. You're dying of thirst. The gate's before you.

"Grehg found himself at the feet of a dreaded Bladetail Dragon! It raised its deadly tail and attacked‚Äîshooting him with its crossbow."

@skycurser his handgun?

"The Knight whispered to his conspirator, 'WE KILL THE KING TONIGHT.' (SORRY‚ÄîCAPS LOCK IS BROKEN) A GUARD HEARD HIM SHOUT AND ARRESTED HIM."

"The Colonel addressed them. 'These aliens formed just after "The Big Bang." They all thought of sex, but no one laughed. It was serious."

"Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.' Yet he kept quothing, though he promised he wouldn't. I laid down newspaper, but there was quoth everywhere."

"The barbarian, with 20+ years axe experience swung down, missing the stationary slime and cutting his foot off. 'Fuckin' dice rolls.'"

"The Robot was super intelligent and totally metal‚Äîlike Einstein wearing a Slayer shirt."

"Then, Alura jumped down and‚ÄîBRB getting a soda. Okay I'm back‚Äîsliced the foe across his midsection."

"And finally, Kylo Ren slowly removed his helmet to reveal a huge, momentous twist that no one saw coming: he was a black man all along."

"Dear Readers,
I apologize for my unintentionally offensive and liberal use of 'CUNTOOM' as the onomatopoeia for the Venus Woman's raygun."

"It was said that Dragonarius would return one day to wreak havoc upon the world again. Luckily, global warming destroyed the planet first."

"The wicked Storm King summoned a massive downpour on top of the heroes. Jellena readied her axe, 'Let's end this King's rain.'"

TO BE CONTINUED

Join the characters you thought just died in their next epic adventure! Due out next year!"

"The alien pyramid was awe-inspiring. The walls were on the sides, with a ceiling up top. The walls were covered in those ancient cartoons."

"Captain Mig performed a computer scan for any information on the evil Plutonian Emperor. 'Damn, his Spacebook account is set to private.'"

"'The orcs advance. Time for your first battle!' he told me. Like a hobbit in a public restroom, I was going to have to get my feet wet."

@celebrimbored literally, literately, and a little literary.

"Zera walked the streets of the Elven city. She noticed there were lots of Elves doing Elf stuff like being tall, pointing their ears, etc."

"'I'm the rhyming troll of yore,
Are you prepared for what's in store?
To leave this place I ask thee,
I won't fight back, please kill me?'"

"'Approaching event horizon, sir!'
'Good. Time to see where this black hole takes us.'
It took them to Heaven. Because it killed them."

"Hempas the pot smoking Gargoyle was stoned every day."

"'I am now Gandalf the White.'
'So you're more powerful?'
'Yes, my new staff can shine way brighter.'"

"The festering zombie was really disgusting. I can't really explain it. Just know that I'm gagging as I write this. Yeah, it's THAT gross."

@thegynomite grats!

The barbarian chuckled to himself as he flexed his biceps (which are located in his chest because he's an alien).

"Blood poured from Mering's mouth as he fell. Luckily, Mering was a vampire and it wasn't his blood; it was from the guy he was sucking."
