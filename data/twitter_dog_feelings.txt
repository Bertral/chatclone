outside is larger than you think. which is why i always have my leash. so the human doesn’t get lost

gooooob morning. i was hoping to wake up to the smell of waffles. i deserve a waffle

the small neighbor human. is kicking around a black and white ball. and whenever it goes more than a few feet. they hold their arms out wide. and look around. as if the whole world is watching

the sky booms have begun. and we all know how scary they can be. so the human and i are headed to the shelter. to comfort some pups. who don’t yet have. someone to hold them

let me be perfectly clear. you don’t stand a chance. against these cuddles

i’d like to take a moment. to tell you about my stuffed fren sebastian. he is my closest confidant. my brightest shadow. he has big floppy ears. a long skinny nose. and his arm has only fallen off twice. he is the definition of good company. and without him. i’d be lost

i’m sitting next to the human. as they put on their shoes to leave. i glanced at the door. then slowly up at them. with the widest eyes i could manage. long story short. we’re working from home today

gooooob morning. sometimes when the human is still asleep. i will quietly climb onto their face. and wait patiently for them to wake up. this normally does not take very long

IT IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY. MY CONFIDENCE IS SOARING. GIVE ME MY LEASH I’LL WALK MYSELF. LOOK AT THESE HIPS SWAY

do not worry ronald. i’m on my way. and my stuffed fren sebastian. is coming with me https://t.co/QZttby5DnK

so sorry to interrupt. but i hope all your dreams come true

the small neighbor human. has a big new toy in their yard. if you jump on it. you boumce. sometimes we jump at the same time. this is called a double boumce. i always knew we could fly. we just needed a little help

all i need right now. is to rest my chin. in the palm of your hand. sometimes my noggin gets heavy. probably from all the knowledge

i forgot to say. one at a time https://t.co/tgXAUEB93L

i’m going to help you stay calm. and very organized. for 16 whole months. my planner is available now

https://t.co/tsZt10Twx9 https://t.co/Nj1KeePfhH

i have an announcement

i was told. whenever a square car with sirens passes by. they are on their way to help. so i always howl along. to let everyone know. i’m helping too

i like to leave as much of my hair. around the house as possible. it is my confetti. i am a party

gooooob morning. the human starts every day. with a cup of warm bean juice. they say it makes them fast. i tried to sneak a taste. but was quickly denied. this is far from fair. i wanna be fast too

the human worked all day. so we didn’t spend much time together. this upsets them more than anything. because who knows how long any of us have. but they’re here now. and i really hope they realize. all i need. is for them to hold my paw. until i fall asleep

gooooob morning. the first time you wake up. could be a mistake. it’s best to fall back to sleep. just to be safe

the human invited a new fren over tonight. it’s going well. but they seem a little nervous. this is to be expected. as i set the bar pretty high around here

i am happy to report. that my stuffed fren sebastian’s surgery was a success. he’s been prescribed lots of bed rest. which is perfect. i love bed rest

i was playing with my stuffed fren sebastian. when his arm fell all the way off. there’s no need to worry. because among many other things. my human is a surgeon

to be perfectly clear. i love you

sometimes. the human needs a break from the world. so i grab my leash. drop it in their hand. and we take a walk. where all we have to focus on. is putting one paw in front of the other

gooooob morning. it is way too early to be conscious. but we must persevere. because i have to pee

the small neighbor human. has been teaching me how to roll over. but i usually stop halfway. this is the belly rub toll. and i will not complete the trick. until it is paid

the human is going out tonight. to see some of their frens. which is fine. i’ll be okay by myself. i totally didn’t wanna cuddle. until we both fall asleep

we were at the store today. and i found a stuffed penguin that i really fancied. i tried to carry it out. but was stopped before the exit. i am not a criminal. i just have no money

i’m a simple pup. i don’t need much. just your attention at all times. and for everyone i ever meet to love me a whole bunch

i know you have a lot going on right now. so i just want to say. i think you’re doing great

gooooob morning. the human is working from home today. but i require attention. so i’m going to sit in their lap. and randomly press buttons on their computer. until they give up

WE ARE GOING TO THE BEACH. I CAN SMELL THE OCEAN. I’M GOING TO EAT THE SAND

i made more love cards. this time they’re for mother’s day. because moms are special. i hope you like them

https://t.co/yhAbwIkQRo https://t.co/J9fz67EMF1

i’ve been lying in the same spot. for several hours. some may think i’m lazy. but i bet they’ve never been so focused. on a skittle under a fridge

gooooob morning. the human made me a pancake. in the shape of a heart. it tasted similar to a circle pancake. but meant a lot more

the small neighbor human. has enlisted my help. finding colorful eggs in the garden. i tried to eat the first one i found. but apparently that’s not the objective

if you see me sitting outside a store. being all good. while my human shops inside. you must come pat my noggin. that’s the law

if someone could hold me for a bit. that’d be nice

gooooob morning. i walked the small neighbor human. to the bus at the end of the street again. but this time. before they got on. they knelt down and promised. they’d be back before i knew it

whenever i do a little jog. the tags on my collar start to jingle. this signals to my surroundings. that the goodness approaches

i am snuggling with my stuffed fren sebastian. and the human is snuggling with me. according to the transitive property of snugs. the human is also snuggling sebastian

the human likes to cover my eyes with my ears. and pretend there’s been a power outage. i go along with this. because it makes them very happy

gooooob morning. i’m going to need a lot of attention today. i can just tell

nobody ever told me. when you wake up from a nap. you can immediately start another one. that was something i figured out. all by myself

i wasn’t a good dog today

april fools. i was so good

occasionally. the freezer will provide crunch water. this is way better than regular water. because of the crunch

me and my stuffed fren sebastian. are heading to the movies. because there's a very special film. about an elephant named #dumbo. who looks just like sebastian. and is almost as magical #ad

gooooob morning. i am already tangled. in the cords behind the couch. please set the household alert level to dark grey. and note that i’m requesting immediate assistance

i’ve been thinking about it a lot. and i love you

we went to a new park today. and right at the entrance. was a big bucket of tennis balls with a little sign. that the human said was there in memory of a very good dog. who really liked tennis balls. and that i could play with one. to help that very good dog be remembered

the human is fast asleep. but i jumped on their bed. and cuddled close. to remind them that i love them. because the nighttime is long. and i’m worried they might forget

gooooob morning. at some point today i'm going to wink at the human. but i will do it very quickly. and only once. so they spend all week wondering if it actually happened

we were in the car. stopped at a grey light. when i accidentally dropped my stuffed fren sebastian out the window. the human saved him. and as far as i could tell. nobody in the cars around us. seemed to mind the delay

the small neighbor human. stopped by the house after school. i guess they hate a thing called math. and really needed to tell someone. as long as they don’t stop petting me. i am a fabulous listener

apparently. we lost an entire hour of sleep the other night. which is rude. so to get my revenge. i will be sleeping all day every day. for the rest of the year

my stuffed fren sebastian. is a little shy. but he wanted me to tell you. he thinks you’re doing great

hi. if you would like to cuddle. i certainly wouldn’t oppose

WE ARE AT THE PARK. BUT THE HUMAN SAYS IT’S TIME TO LEAVE. WHICH DOESN’T MAKE SENSE. BECAUSE THEY CAN’T CATCH ME

today the sun shined for the first time in a while. so i spent the evening outside. rolling on my back and kicking the air. to show my appreciation. and my pizzazz

gooooob morning. i’m so glad you’re awake. an urgent matter requires your immediate attention. it’s me

i’m going to take my nap. but the household must remain protected. so i left sebastian. and a few other stuffed frens. right at the front door. to guard against any intruders

gooooob morning. i would like a pancake

when i run through the house. with paws full of mud. please remember. i am making art. i am an artist

i’m sorry i forgot to say gooooob morning. i woke up. and was immediately distracted by everything

i had been asleep several hours. when the human decided to wake me up with a hug. that’s no problem. it’s what i’m here for

on our walk today. we passed the cutest pup in the world. i was too scared to say anything. and just kept walking. but i’m telling everyone. i have a valentine

i will love you. for all eternity. and in return. could you please wipe away my eye boogers

i have a meeting very shortly. with my stuffed fren sebastian. to go over the dangers of raisins. but my ear just turned inside out. and he can’t see me like this

there was a sandwich. on the edge of the counter. and now there isn’t. those are all the details. we can confirm so far. the piece of lettuce on my nose. is purely circumstantial

oh don’t mind me. i just love you

the commercial on the tv. made a doorbell noise. i know deep down it wasn’t my doorbell. but. there’s no harm in making sure

gooooob morning. be sure to start your day with a stretchum. maybe even a wiggle. now you’re ready for anything. the haters won’t know what hit them

the human has a new fren coming over tonight. and i’ve prepared. a simple entrance survey for them

6. do you like me
c. how much do you like me
2. do you jump in puddles
a. i like to jump in puddles
b. can i lick your ear
3. do you like me
7. i’m already licking your ear

gooooob morning. i am making the executive decision. that it is too cold. to do anything at all today. secure a cuddle buddy. and recommence your snoozles

i fell asleep with my tongue out. and the human decided to poke it. i should really know better by now. they do that every time

i made you three love cards. and a pack of love stickers. to give to anyone you want. you could also keep them. and pretend they’re from me

⇨ https://t.co/HazNaLlJVq https://t.co/bGEOnxQUsw

WE’RE GOING TO THE PARK. AND I’M BRINGING MY STUFFED FREN SEBASTIAN. AND I’M GOING TO SHOW HIM. TO EVERYBODY

ibuprofen. is just evil skittles. please feel better carbon https://t.co/MMkh67Yfdz

i’ve been talking a lot. with my stuffed fren sebastian. and we strongly believe. that cuddles are crucial. and should be distributed bountifully

sometimes. i'll lean against your leg. and it's not because. i'm afraid to lose my balance. it's just that. i'm afraid to lose you

the human took a little swab of my cheek. and is sending it away. to see what type of pup i am. but i don’t need the results. i’m 100% fabulous

gooooob morning. i’ve been giving it a lot of thought. and i really think. today is your day

i just found out. that not everything is about me. and i’m devastated. to say the least

the human went out tonight. and i hope they’re having fun. but i can’t fall asleep. until they’ve returned safe and sound. so for the sake of my snoozle. please hurry home

i don’t mean to interrupt. but i love you

sometimes. when i first wake up. i can’t open my eyes all the way. but i’m still excited for what the day could bring. so i pair the squint. with a little smile. while the household recognizes its king

tonight is a very big night. i scheduled a playdate. with the neighbor pup. and after i introduce them. to my stuffed fren sebastian. we’re going to watch the skittle under the fridge. together

gooooob morning. the human is off to do. whatever they do to provide for us. and i am off. to wiggle around on my back a bit. we both contribute in our own way

i found a really good stick. but i chewed it too hard. and it broke in half. which was disappointing until i realized. now i have two sticks. today has been. an emotional roller coaster

it’s time to say goodbye. to my tree fren steven. so we took down his lights. and all his special orbs. the human says he’ll be back soon. but it’s still okay to be sad. which is comforting. because that’s exactly what i am

gooooob morning. i was told that this year. is the year of the belly rub. please don’t look that up. you can trust me

my new year’s resolution. is to find a way. to love you more

i was lying on the couch. all snuggled up with the human. when they got up and left the room. it’s like they don’t know. that without attention. i will explode

gooooob morning. there is a box. underneath my tree fren steven. that smells like peanut butter. i am trying my best. to remain calm. but i think it’s for me

i forgot to tell the human. what i wanted for christmas. but that’s okay. it’s hard to wrap a hug

i helped put tiny lights. all around my tree fren steven. and now that it’s nighttime. he is fabulous

there is a tree. growing inside the house. it wasn’t here earlier. but it’s here now. the human doesn’t seem concerned. so i think its our family now. he will be my veggie fren. and i shall call him steven

some things in life. just aren’t fair. for example. i keep having to scoot over. to stay in the path of this sunbeam. shining through the window

the human just came home. smelling like another dog. this isn’t a problem. i’m totally not upset. if anybody needs me. i’ll be over here. wondering what i ever did to deserve this

gooooob morning. i think. you’re gonna do great today

the human seems distracted. so i put my paw on their knee. and now they know. that whatever it is. we’re in it together

i have a toy that looks like a cupcake. and sometimes. i squeak it very loud. for a very long time. i don’t mean to be annoying. i was in the zone

THE GARAGE DOOR IS OPENING. THE HUMAN IS HOME. THE WEEKEND HAS BEGUN. PLEASE HELP. I CAN’T STOP SPINNING

my stuffed fren sebastian. is being washed as we speak. the time apart can be lonely. but i can be patient. for when he emerges from the dryer. he’ll be super toasty

my reflection has never fooled me. that couldn’t be another dog. nobody else. is so good looking

gooooob morning. i spotted the human. secretly putting a piece of pancake in my bowl. so the next time i get a drink. boom. surprise pancake. i am eternally grateful

the human was planning on going out tonight. but i sat in front of the door. and made eye contact once. so now we’re watching movies

i was only outside for a minute. when a snowflake landed on my nose. i hurried inside. to show my stuffed fren sebastian. but by the time i found him. my wintery pal was gone

i have performed my final security lap. around the household. i’m happy to report. snoozles are a go

gooooob morning. i don’t mean to alarm anyone. but i’m feeling great

sometimes. i lie down during a walk. and refuse to get up. so the human has no choice. but to spend more time with me

the household is filled. with so many smells. ready your tippy taps. today has potential

gooooob morning. our walk was very chilly. but i wasn’t bothered. because i wore a jacket. and it had hedgehogs on it

every time the human comes home. i must be ready with a gift. most of the time they return unexpectedly. and i panic. so the gift is almost always. whatever is closest to me

one of my biggest goals. is to eat a leaf. during the nighttime. this is known as a dark crunch. and it’s very advanced

i have asked the human. to clear their schedule https://t.co/1LFv7e3j6A

i may have already mentioned this. but i love you

gooooob morning. i helped walk the small neighbor human. to the bus at the end of the street. i tried to get on with them. but was quickly denied. they know that with an education. i’d be too powerful

the human has spent all day. organizing yard leaves into one big pile. i can only assume. it’s so i can jump in it

my ball rolled under the couch. and i cannot reach it. the human has been informed of the issue. and reminded. that my problems. are their problems

you’re wrong. one day you’ll have a dog. and they’ll be special in their own ways. they might have a stuffed fren. or like to hop in puddles. you might even have a skittle under the fridge. but they’ll do many other things. that’s why they’ll be yours. that’s why you’ll love them https://t.co/osUrG6emFA

i took a little trip. to the school down the road. and waited very patiently. as the human checked some boxes. to try and change the world

rumor has it. we get an extra hour to snoozle tonight. i can’t wait to tell my stuffed fren sebastian. this magical news. he’s going to be so excited

i accidentally dropped my ball. in my water bowl. technically making a soup. i am an innovator

the tiny monsters are on their way. and my job. is to hold a bucket of candy for them. i’m not allowed to have any myself. but i expect many pats for my services. and those are just as sweet

gooooob morning. it is the spooky day

hi. it’s me again. i love you

if you’re packing to go somewhere. and leave your suitcase open. i’m allowed to climb inside. and then you have to take me with you. it’s the law

gooooob morning. you can do it. but if you need help. i’m just a noggin pat away

if your day didn’t go well. that’s perfectly fine. because now you get to dream. and who knows what could happen. i hope i dream i’m a penguin. so i can zoom on my belly

today was pumpkin carving day. and i was given. my very own little pumpkin. but i got too attached to it. and when it was time to carve. i didn’t let anyone near it. i saved it from the knife. and in the pumpkin realm. i am a hero

sometimes. i’ll get really feisty. and nibble on the human’s sleeve. to remind them i am a descendant. of the mighty wolf

gooooob morning. i wanted to wake up earlier. but i forgot why. so i didn’t

one time. i was having a nightmare. and the human noticed. so they held my paw. to make sure i knew. everything was going to be okay

the nights are getting colder. and i think it would really improve. my quality of snoozle. if you tucked me into bed

gunner. listen closely. cancer doesn’t stand a chance against you https://t.co/eMIefgcdhg

it is not the taste of the leaves. that intrigues me. it is the crunch

exactly one year ago. a package arrived for me. and little did i know. that inside. would be the very best stuffed fren. anyone could ever ask for. happy birthday sebastian

gooooob morning. it is a new day. a new chance. for you to change the world. i would do it myself. but then who would watch the skittle. under the fridge

the human has only smiled once today. it was when i rolled over. with my feets in the air. and sneezed. it wasn’t on purpose. but they seemed to really enjoy it. so since then. i’ve been lying on my back. desperately trying to sneeze

do not underestimate. the healing power. of a stuffed fren https://t.co/ps4ZjRFlYN

i have locked myself in the bathroom. do not ask me how it happened. because i don’t have that information. hopefully. my stuffed fren sebastian. has already called. the proper authorities

over the summer. the human tried to grow tomatoes in the backyard. but every so often. i would sneak over. and graze on them. like a brontosaurus

gooooob morning. i am already very tired. so we’re going to try this whole thing. again tomorrow

the small neighbor human. wants to learn how to take a pup on a walk. it was determined. that i am the perfect candidate. to show them how it’s done.. we’ve gone up and down our little street. several times. and have only gotten super tangled once. so it’s going really well

i like to sit on one side of the couch. but sometimes. i sit on the other side of the couch. just to keep. everyone on their toes

i was outside. minding my own business. when a leaf fell on my noggin. i will consider it my crown. and i will rule these lands benevolently

i am exhausted. and if it’s okay with you. i’d like to redeem. this all-inclusive ticket. to snoozle city

the human just got home. and once they are settled. i will carefully attempt. to remove a sock from their foot. using the most delicate of nibbles. so they know i missed them

the human has guests coming over this evening. and my plan. is to introduce. each and every one of them. to my stuffed fren sebastian. everybody loves my stuffed fren sebastian

you’re not alone doby. i get anxious when the human leaves too. let’s put you back together https://t.co/mzruA0851F

if you don’t mind. i’m gonna love you a whole lot

a lot of things in life are unpredictable. but not the skittle under the fridge. it just sits there. and i just watch it

gooooob morning. i met a little turtle on our walk. they were very busy. and i only got to say hi. before they returned to important work. inside their shell

the human just took a picture of me. from really up close. which makes the picture look. like i took it myself. they find this very funny

sometimes. i’m inside. and want to go outside. but as soon as the human opens the door. i change my mind. this is not my fault. i am a fluid. yet increasingly complicated soul

gooooob morning. today is full of possibilities. maybe i’ll do things. or maybe i won’t

i just hopped in a puddle. during the nighttime. this is called a dark splash. and i am fearless

the sports are happening. and based on the human’s reactions. they are happening well. but also not well sometimes

i hope the human. is in the mood for a hug. because i could really use one

gooooob morning. i had a dream. that i was chasing my tail. and started spinning so fast. i went back in time. and high-fived a dinosaur

a human is at the door with a package. i know i’m supposed to bork around. perhaps even cause a rumpus. but they’re just doing their job. and i’m kind of tired. so i’ll just wiggle a bit. and smile through the window. to thank them for the gift

sometimes. i wonder if there’s more to life. than being ridiculously good-looking

every time i get brushed. i have to take my collar off. the human always laughs. and says that i’m naked. but joke’s on them. i’m very confident in my body

if you’re ever sad. or in desperate need of snugs. do not worry. because i’ll come find you. and you bet. i’m bringing my stuffed fren sebastian with me

gooooob morning. the human is trying to leave. but i’m touching them. faster than they can use a lint roller

today is #NationalDogDay. and according to me. i get three wishes. they are as follows:

7. catch tail. but in front of a crowd
c. a nice belly rub 
2. peanut butter pancakes for dinner

i brought my stuffed fren sebastian. with me on our walk this morning. but then i found a really nice stick. and i couldn’t carry both. so i kept sebastian. and let the human carry the stick. they seem annoyed. but actually they love me

i really like your jacket jenny. you can have my knee. until yours is fixed https://t.co/ETfsYKJJHH

sometimes. i hear my fren bork. so i start borking. even if i have no idea what i’m borking about. you cannot convince me. i’m not helping

i just woke up. from my early afternoon snoozle. which means we’re not far away. from the midafternoon snoozle. but i may have to reschedule. the pre-evening snoozle. i’m just too busy

today. was a very long day. but sometimes. long days are necessary. and if they end. with me in your lap. well then i think everything is gonna be alright

THE BIG YELLOW CAR HAS RETURNED. THE SMALL NEIGHBOR HUMAN IS BACK. i met them at the stop. and did several speedy circles. to make sure they were not harmed. they confirmed for me there was plenty of snacks. so all is well. i told you guys not to worry

we have a predicament. i just watched the small neighbor human. skip down the street. and get on board. the biggest yellow car i have ever seen

where are they taking them? why wasn’t i invited? did they remember to pack. enough snacks for the day? are they ever. coming back?

there’s a super cozy blanket. that the human and i. both really like. i think i should get to use it tonight. and the human thinks. they should get to use it tonight. so we comprimised. and now i’m super cozy

we had a big adventure planned for today. but the sky droplets just won’t stop. so i think we’ll watch a movie. and cuddle so close. we become. a single entity

a shaved butt is a confident look. and bowie. you pull it off so well https://t.co/hhREjNPBzU

the small neighbor human. is hanging outside with some ice cream. and it is melting. way faster than it is being eaten. the only real solution here. is for me to trot over and help

it is difficult. to perform a good sit. when my feets keep sliding away from me. this is why. i believe the entire household. should be carpeted. thank you for your time

gooooob morning. before the human left. to do whatever they do. they gave my fren and i. a longer hug than usual. i’m not sure what was on their mind. but it’s certainly gone now. because our long hugs. are very powerful

if i happen. to lie down on your foot. you’re not allowed to move. you should feel honored

the human said. they might make pancakes in the morning. so the faster i fall asleep. the sooner i get a pancake. as you can imagine. it’s hard to snoozle. under so much pressure

the human’s fren came over. for the first time in a long time. i tried to show them. how the skittle under the fridge. still hasn’t moved. but they didn’t seem super interested. that’s okay. we all have different passions

gooooob morning. today is your day. and if it is not. well who really cares. i still love you lots

WE’RE GOING ON A HIKE. AND I’M CARRYING MY TRAVEL BOWL. IN CASE OF THIRST. BUT I HAVE To keep stopping. and looking back. because the human is slow. and i am speedy

sometimes. i let out a little grunt. this could mean i’m hungry. or tired. or that i’m happy you’re around. on very special occasions. it means all three

i always make sure. to say goodnight to my stuffed fren sebastian. it’s the simplest way. to prevent all the nightmares. and let him know he matters

a fun fact about me. is that i love you

the human is flapping my ears. and acting like i’m flying. it is quite clear i’m still on the ground. but that’s not important. i know how much they enjoy this

sometimes. i roll over onto my back. with my feets in the air. but then forget why i did. so i slowly return to my side. and hope no one saw me

the human went out. to have fun with some frens. they promised they’d be back soon. so i’m not worried at all. and in the meantime. i found an old jacket. that smells like they’re still here. it will be my new bed. until they return

i was awoken from my snoozle. by a car coming down the street. quite rude of them to be honest. i was dreaming of peanut butter

gooooob morning. there are people on the roof. the human says they’re fixing it. but i’m not convinced. please set the household alert level. to light gray

these crossed paws. are no accident. i’m feeling fancy

everything. is going to be alright. because guess what. i love you

on our walk today. i tried to say hello to a person passing by. but they backed away. and continued on. without so much as a smile. the human later explained. that not everyone is going to like me. and i need to be okay with that. but here’s the thing.. i’m not okay with that

higgins. listen closely. that cancer doesn’t stand a chance against you https://t.co/TukDseGoRR

sometimes. i will yawn really big. and soon after. the human will also yawn. i have yet to decide. what to do with my powers

gooooob morning. today is a very busy day.. after the midday snoozle. i have a meeting with my stuffed fren sebastian. about what to do. if we’re ever separated in public. then it’s my turn. to watch the skittle under the fridge. this is of course. followed by another snoozle

i can fit in your lap. no measurements required. just trust me

i found. the perfect spot in the yard. where the sun shines through the trees. and toasts me like a marshmallow

the night snoozle. has arrived once more. please assemble your snugs. and brace for perfect dreams. tomorrow awaits

the human took my fren. on a special sunset walk. they didn’t use his wagon. they just walked real slow. and i watched from the window. as they smiled the whole time

gooooob morning. the human made waffles. and i got to taste one. what i’m trying to say. is never give up on your dreams

sometimes. i don’t know what to do. with all my love. occasionally it overflows. in the form of a burp

i have stolen a yogurt lid. from the trash. it’s nothing personal. i was just feeling angsty. but now the human is chasing me. and i have no choice. but to evade them spectacularly

the human invited many guests. to the household this evening. but i reserved a whole room to myself. i have special headphones. to ward off the sky booms. i have my stuffed fren sebastian. to keep me company. and the human plans to check in on me. every other minute

your premature sky booms. will not be tolerated

in case you were wondering. i love you

TODAY IS ADVENTURE DAY. MY WATER BOWL IS PACKED. THE WINDOWS ARE ROLLED DOWN. AND YES. MY FEETS ARE A TIPPY TAPPIN

i accidentally dropped my bone. on the human’s bare foot. they did not enjoy this. and i don’t know how to tell them. i’m so sorry

gooooob morning. i was watching from the window. as the human left to go do whatever they do. and i guess they saw me. because they ran back inside. to give a few extra pats. before leaving again

sometimes. you have to spin in circles. to appreciate all that’s around you

on the walk today. we stumbled across a playground. i learned that slides only work one way. and the human carried my fren. up to the highest part there. i bet they could see. the whole world

cancer. doesn’t stand a chance. you got this harper https://t.co/F280jteT3Y

some people say it must be nice. to not know of all the bad stuff in the world. but that’s not true. i know it’s there. how else could i be the perfect antidote

gooooob morning. i am going to have. a great day. i haven’t figured out how yet. but that’s not important

i caught my tail today. it wasn’t for long. but i did it. my stuffed fren sebastian saw it happen. and he can vouch for me

the human is hosting a get together this evening. and i am told there will be snacks. so my goal. will be to convince every single guest. that i have not eaten. in several weeks

the human is working from the household today. so my mission so far. has been to allow as little work. as possible

sometimes. the human presses their noggin against mine. to figure out what i’m thinking. so i just think really hard. about how much i love them. and hope they figure it out

gooooob morning. the human made pancakes. for the first time in a long time. they even saved one. for my fren and i to split. the only problem. was that i ate my piece so fast. i didn’t even taste it

nighttime has arrived. the long snoozle can be ignored no longer. please send all snugs dogward

we met a very kind human. who told me i was good. during our afternoon walk. i'm circling them slowly. to trap them with my leash. and when i succeed. they'll have to finish the walk with us. that's the law

gooooob morning. the human has a big day today. so i lent them my stuffed fren sebastian. he believes in everyone

something. you may not realize you’re allowed to do. is take a snoozle. and then when you wake up. immediately start another one

WE ARE IN THE CAR. NOT SURE WHERE WE’RE HEADED. BUT THE WINDOWS ARE DOWN. AND I’M EATING THE WIND

i saw the small neighbor wizard. playing outside again. i immediately trotted over. with my stuffed fren sebastian. so i could politely ask them. to make him magic

gooooob morning. i was still sleepy. when we started the sunrise walk. i only took a few steps. before hopping in the wagon with my fren. it was only the human who walked. which was more than fine with us. and definitely not against any rules. don’t worry. i checked

a ladybug has infiltrated the household. it doesn’t seem to want any trouble. maybe it was just lonely. i shall follow it around. slowly and carefully. because i’m a little lonely too

hi. this will only take a moment. but it’s very important. so listen closely 

i love you

one of the small neighbor humans. was outside. blowing magic rainbow spheres. so of course i went over to investigate. i know they were magic. because every time i tried to catch one. it disappeared. i have since concluded. that this small neighbor human. is a wizard

sometimes. it’s easy to tell. that the human’s life is hard. but that’s okay. because i have cuddles. and i’m not going anywhere

a pup a day. keeps all the sadness away https://t.co/FFYtPlboTm

i sneezed. and both my ears went inside out. the household alert level. has been set to very dark grey. i don’t deserve this

gooooob morning. i found a spot outside. where the sun breaks through the trees. and creates a perfectly toasty paradise. today has potential

i watched from the window. as the neighbor pup. walked up and down the street with their human. for the first time. they hopped and zoomed and got impressively tangled. 

in other words. they did so well

the human’s fren has arrived. when they opened the door. i was waiting with a shoe. as a gift. that nobody can prove was stolen. it must be family movie night

the human came home early. and gave me the biggest hug. i’m not sure how they knew i wanted one

i’m going to wear it. every time a car pulls into the driveway. to turn around. and not to say hi to me https://t.co/GythR4drvn

the funny thing about your attention. is that. i need it

it is sky boom season. so if anyone needs me. i’ll be hiding in the bathtub. with my stuffed fren sebastian

gooooob morning. the sun is shining. the birbs are chirping. and my tail thuds. echo through the household. as the human rubs my belly

i just started my shift. watching the skittle under the fridge. part of me thinks. it may never move. but then again. what if it does

i heard. that today is about the moms. and although i technically adopted. my stuffed fren sebastian. i still hope. he got me something nice

i finally said hi to the new neighbors. i took my stuffed fren sebastian with me. to break the ice of course. the new neighbor pup seemed to like him. and one of the small humans. gave me a hug. i think it went well

the human went over. and said hi to the new neighbors. then returned to inform me. that they have several small humans. and if i were to say hi. i would have to be. very gentle

WE HAVE NEW NEIGHBORS. THEY ARE UNPACKING AND OH MY GOODNESS. THEY HAVE A PUP FREN. I REPEAT THEY HAVE A PUP. WE HAVE A NEW NEIGHBOR PUP FREN

gooooob morning. i just completed. a series of elaborate stretchems. the world isn’t ready for me

it was raining during our walk today. but that’s alright. the human brought an umbrella. and i hopped in a puddle

where is the car. i would like a word with it https://t.co/ZC3wj0zAR8

the human hasn’t smiled much today. and i’m not sure why. but i have a squeaker toy that looks like a cupcake. and i am coming. to the rescue

i have just completed. my final security lap around the household. all is well. ready your snoozles. the nighttime is here

we went on a big walk. i was even allowed to bring. my stuffed fren sebastian. he sat in the wagon with my other fren. while i navigated.. when the household became visible. on the way back. the human unhooked my leash. and i ran the rest of the way. i was so speedy

THE HUMAN IS HOME EARLY. THIS IS QUITE UNEXPECTED. THE GARAGE DOOR IS OPENING. MY TAIL IS BLURRY. AND YOU BET. MY FEETS ARE A TIPPY TAPPIN

a human stopped by the household. with a package. so i met them at the door. with my favorite bone. ready to barter. but they just smiled at me. left the package. and drove away

kendal my fren. it is not good. to hold in your emotions https://t.co/8sP0iYmLls

the human and the human’s fren. are going to the movies tonight. and once again. my fren and i were not invited. not even my stuffed fren sebastian. was asked to go. oh well. we will have our own infinity war. with toilet paper. and whatever shoes we can find

sometimes. after a passionate bork. my tooth can get stuck. on the outside of my mouth. and i become way less intimidating. than is ideal

gooooob morning. i tried to eat a flower. but the human saw me. before i got a taste. i have no excuse for my actions. it just looked yummy

i think. something we’ve been overlooking. for some time now. is that i love you

it is better to zoom. and tear something. than to never zoom at all https://t.co/pMSaJYLRow

you have a legal obligation. to let me rest my noggin. in your lap. whenever i so desire. it’s the law

sometimes. certain areas of the floor can be tastier. than others. this has been a puplick surface announcement

i encountered a tiny human. at the park today. who happened to have a stick. which i desired greatly. they seemed to know this. because they did not relinquish it to me. until i gave them a hug

gooooob morning. before the human left the household today. they promised my fren and i. they’d come home early. so we can go on a family adventure. i shall wait by the door. until that time

gooooob morning. i have a feeling. today will be a good day. and if it’s not. well that’s alright too. because there’s always tomorrow. and there’s always peanut butter

the human rolled a ball. right by my snoot. signaling the start of playtime. but there’s no time for that. i have way more important things going on right now. like monitoring this skittle. under the fridge

i have a very important message. it is of the highest priority. and it requires. your immediate. undivided attention

i love you

on the walk this morning. we passed our neighbor. who knelt down. to say i am a very good dog. my human interrupted and said. they tell me that all the time. i quickly glanced back to indicate. that they should. let this new person tell me

the human and i. decided to watch a movie together. they kept getting annoyed though. because apparently. i fell asleep. during all the good parts

the night snoozle is upon us once more. i’ve tucked my stuffed fren sebastian. under my chin. he’s afraid of the dark. but i will protect him. no matter what

when i’m standing in the doorway. unsure whether to venture outside. or remain inside. please do not rush me.. trust me

i was enjoying myself on the porch. when a gust of wind. smacked me in the face. i lost complete control of both ears. for what seemed like an eternity. i’m still. quite frazzled

i really want a cape. i think it would. make my zooms. much more distinguished. i would secure the admiration of the neighborhood. in an instant

today. i wasn’t a very good dog

april fools. i was so good

the human has discovered. that they enjoy. lightly poking my cheek. i don’t know why that is. but i let it happen. because i see how happy. it makes them

bruce. do not worry my fren. nothing can stop you. and that is one fancy red coat https://t.co/gzCqRnR7dZ

gooooob morning. the human has this device. that removes my hair. from their nice clothes. in several swift rolls. i have stolen it. and now. i must destroy it

i didn’t do. much of anything today. but that’s alright. it’s best to stay consistent

i had already commenced my night snoozle. when the human decided they were hungry. according to the law. i am awarded a small portion. of whatever food is made. this is called. a dark snackum

gooooob morning. we just got back from a magical walk. it was chilly. but if you zoom periodically. it gets warmer. the human put extra blankets. in the wagon for my fren. who was in charge of navigation. we were a force. to be reckoned with

if we’re being really honest. i think. we should celebrate puppies. every day. just a thought

i don’t mind the vacuum. but i certainly. don’t trust it

i know. you’ve got a lot going on right now. but guess what. i love you

sometimes. when i’m outside. performing my obligatory yard shenanigans. the human will call me. but i pretend not to hear them. so the shenanigans. may continue

i’ve learned that many things in life. are unpredictable. one thing that is not. is my ability. to fit in your lap

gooooob morning. i was performing. the morning security lap. around the household. when i tripped on a chord.. at the exact same time. in a seemingly unrelated event. a lamp fell off the table and broke. there is no way to confirm. what caused this

sometimes. when i can’t fall asleep. i’ll pull my stuffed fren sebastain closer. and think about. all the wondrous landscapes. i’ve yet to zoom across

there is an easy way to tell. if i would like. a belly rub. and it’s that i do

the mission for the morning. is a maximum delay. of the human’s departure. with the help of my fren. we shall execute. the illustrious. double shoe heist.. it is exactly. what it sounds like

gooooob morning. today is a day. to reflect upon. your latest accomplishments. here are mine:

4. big jump
b. zooms of the speedy variety
1. carried stick
9. borked away. evildoers 
2. big leap (different than a jump}
2. ate a funny bug
d. spit out funny bug
7. loved everything

I HEAR THE GARAGE DOOR. IT IS OPENING. THE HUMAN IS HOME EARLY. MY FEETS. ARE A TIPPY TAPPIN

i am certain. i buried a bone. in this exact spot last week. but i just dug it up. and did not find. the bone in question.. i don’t know what to believe anymore. there is only one explanation. the yard. is haunted

i was all ready. for a lovely. relaxing walk this morning. when the human decided. we were going to run. the whole thing. i did not consent to this. and i feel like. i’m gonna die

lily. if you don't get better soon. i'm sure there's a way. we can share. my lungs https://t.co/wIjFI5PQ4c

gooooob morning. do not forget to perform. your post snoozle stretchems. they are a crucial part. of anyone's success

i have the late shift. watching the skittle. under the fridge tonight. i closed my eyes to yawn. and i think it moved. but i'm not sure. so you can imagine. the kind of stress. i am under

i had a nightmare. that i was playing. with my stuffed fren sebastian. outside. and the wind blew him away. i'm not sure how the human knew. about the nightmare. but now they're on the ground. cuddling with me

i acted. like i needed to go to the bathroom. but actually. i just wanted to feel the raindrops. on my noggin

the human. took away my stuffed fren sebastian. for the night. apparently. he needs to be washed again. but i found out where this happens. and i shall commence my snoozle. right next to the spinny bath. so neither of us. are alone

sometimes. i get very excited. and all i want to do. is wag my tail. but every single time. it is my whole body. that wags

many have told me. how good i am. but let me just say. they’re absolutely right

there are toasty sun beams. coming through the windows. and i will soak in them. until i’m physically relocated. or i burst into flames

just finished. my mid afternoon snoozle. my schedule is now wide open. until dusk. when i will perform. the daily back wiggle

the human yawned. while having dinner. and in that time. my fren stole a french fry.. while i do not condone. such actions. i am wildly impressed

just give me. a long stretch of hardwood floor. with a slice of cheese. at the end. and i’ll show you speed skating

the human and i. have decided. that angels don’t have wings. they have vests. and are covered in fur 
https://t.co/mnV4Uswsub

the human. and the human’s fren. are all dressed up to go out. and once again. my fren and i. don’t seem to be invited.. the good news is. i jumped on them both. so pieces of me. will be tagging along. whether they like it. or not

gooooob morning. i want to formally declare. that my stuffed fren sebastian. is my valentine. there are never before seen. levels of snugs. in his future

i. have two walking speeds. they are as follows.. faster than you. and 
completely. immobile

something. i’ve been thinking about. for a while. is that i love you

the human’s fren came over. and made the mistake. of sitting on the floor. now they must stay there. with me in their lap. for eternity. that is the law

i encourage everyone. to pet the pup. at whatever party you attend tonight. they’re working overtime. and deserve undivided attention

the humans on the tv. are pretty good. but i can do a triple spin. too.. it’s before i lie down. and never on ice. but still

gooooob morning. i am already. several hours into my skittle watching shift. there is no movement. to report so far.. i did however. hear the fridge make new cube water. perhaps this is a warning. of impending battle

our walk today. was rather wet. my fren stayed in his wagon. under a blanket. while i endured the elements

sometimes. when my fren commences the night snoozle. before me. i will rest my chin. on his noggin. to encourage. sweet dreams

there are many humans. in the household. and i will not rest. until every single one. has dropped a chip. in my honor

the human told me. the only reason. i wasn’t drafted in the puppy bowl. is because my opponents. wouldn’t stand a chance

sometimes. there’s a fellow pup. on the tv. and i try to tell them. i enjoy their work. but they never hear me

occasionally. if i see a car come down the street. i will trot swiftly. across the household. while letting out. tiny half borks.. this is to warn the car. that i am to be taken. seriously

we are working on. the shake. which is an advanced move. that requires balance. trust. and more importantly. an intense understanding of unwritten contracts

on my calendar for today. it says. peanut butter. with no further instructions. i accept this challenge

gooooob morning. i made. some love cards

https://t.co/g8UJshEfIv https://t.co/y1tzj7On2s

i had a long talk. with my fren. about how to spot. a fake ball throw. the optimal strategy. is to follow the ball. with your eyes. instead of your heart

otis. i too. have zoomed purely out of passion. you will persevere. and return stronger than ever https://t.co/6oERlzPQIw

the human. spent all day. doing various things. to various foods. there was frustration. and some spills. but i helped with both. just by being there.. i didn’t realize. until the human’s fren came over. that it was all for them. and it didn’t matter. if the food was good. or not

please take note. of the following..
i love you

one time. during a walk. a piece of a bagel. landed right in front of me. the human thinks. a birb dropped it. but i didn’t see a birb.. every time. we return to that spot. i glance up. with the hopes that. another tasty magic bagel drop. happens to me

gooooob morning. the human has left. my fren is monitoring. the skittle under the fridge. and i am on a mission. to find. the most comfortable spot. in every room. of the household

all these snoozles. can get exhausting.. it is a vicious cycle. of peanut butter filled. pseudo-consciousness

after every snoozle. there is a stretchem. one cannot occur. without the other. i don’t make the rules

gooooob morning. the fancy rain. is still falling.. i consulted. my stuffed fren sebastian. and we determined. that today is for snoozles. and nothing else

my fren. has carefully selected. his bone for the day. the problem. is that now i want that bone. and yes. there are plenty. of other bones. in the household. with identical attributes. but none of them compare. to the bone. my fren has right now

sometimes. the human gets sad. and i don’t know why. but if i jump. in their lap. and stay there. i can usually fix it

i understand. that my feets. must be dried. before i re-enter the household. but you are mistaken. if you think. i won’t run around. with the towel. afterwards

the human. and the human’s fren. got dressed up all fancy. to go out tonight. and apparently. i wasn’t invited.. it is not my fault. i can’t tie a tie

duncan. you will beat this. and i love you https://t.co/tsA6LqQKCa

after today’s. ear related calamity. i have vowed not to make. any sudden movements. without human supervision

my ear. is inside out. and the human. is not home to fix it. i have put the household. on alert level. dark grey.

my stuffed fren. sebastian. is always honest with me. when i tell him my ideas. for example. i told him my idea. for dog pants. that have a never ending supply. of peanut butter. in each pocket. but he said. that wouldn’t be. very practical

today. i fell asleep. while i was supposed to be. watching the skittle. under the fridge.. i’m aware that my actions. go against. the household moral code. and will accept my punishment. of reduced couch-bound snoozles. in the morning

a nice human. came to the household. to install some carpet. on the stairs.. to thank them. for the extra traction. i contributed. my close presence. the entire time

i will order some. for the human. and make them put it on. every morning. before they leave https://t.co/B3E9coeMWa

the human. is hosting a get together. this evening. and my job. is to greet the guests. without jumping on them.. a nearly. impossible task

it took until today. for the human. to remove the tree. (basically. big stick] from the household. yet i. still can’t bring any of my favorite sticks. inside. the hypocrisy. is overwhelming

it is. way too chilly. to exit the household. i would like. indoor bathroom accommodations. pronto

i get. the majority. of my work done. between my midday snoozle. and my early afternoon snoozle.. for example. today during that time. i rolled onto my back. and wiggled a bit

gooooob morning. i have stolen. the human’s shoe. in an attempt to. seriously delay. or prevent their departure. entirely

i have performed. the security lap. around the household.. all is well. ready your snugs. snoozetown awaits

i heard. something about. making resolutions. and although i’m perfect. i have a few:

4. more peanut butter
b. increase. zoom efficiency
3. improve my sits
1. convince the human. i’m invisible
4. longer snoozles
f. sticks
2. more peanut butter
7. further turn up. the love dial

gooooob morning. i decided. to congratulate the human. on a good snoozle. with some toilet paper. what i do is. i nibble at the roll. until i secure the end piece. then i run around. like the wind. until it’s all gone.. i hope they like it

the afternoon walk. was very chilly. i made. the executive decision. to quit halfway. and get in the wagon. with my fren. there is no law against this. in the walking rulebook. i checked

the human and i. watched it. together https://t.co/hZnoXbIx2w

the human’s fren. came over. for movie night. but the movie ended. hours ago. i’m usually woken up. around this time. to say goobbye.. i guess they’re trying. a duo snoozle

i was playing. tug of war. with the human. and they scratched my ear. this distraction. was my downfall. and should be. against the law

things have calmed down. in the household. apparently. the house tree. only brings gifts once. so we spent the day. painting flames. on the fren’s wagon. so it looks like. he’s going much faster. than he is.. that was my idea

the human. brought everyone outside. except my fren. who was told to sit and stay. for a moment. we gathered around. the human’s surprise. then called him.. it is the best wagon ever. the human tested it. with me a few times. and let me say. the fren. will love walks. once again

gooooob morning. the house tree. brought gifts. and now. i must remind everyone. that i. am the real gift here

when i awoke. my stuffed fren sebastian. was all cuddled up with me. i brought him closer. and commenced a second snoozle. to make up. for lost dreams

the human took. my stuffed fren sebastian. away. they said he needed. to be washed. and that i could. have him back. in the morning. but that’s a long time. from now.. what if i get lonely

clifford. do not worry. that wiggle. will be corrected. in no time https://t.co/ZlTE8dmL6f

i was deep in snoozle. when the fridge. decided we needed. more cube water.. i checked cube levels. earlier today. that’s the last thing. we need right now

gooooob morning. the human finished. the surprise in the garage. for my fren. but told me. that i must. keep it a secret. a little while longer.. this will be difficult. because all i have. to take. my mind off telling him. is this skittle. under the fridge

the human. just got home. i have no idea. where they’ve been. but in their absence. they’ll be proud to see. that i took it. upon myself. to redistribute. all the footwear. i could find. throughout the household. because i decided. that was. my duty

i have just discovered. a little me. hanging on. the house tree. he is. unbelievably handsome. and i will protect him. at all costs

the human’s fren. is over.. they sat on the floor. and let me snuggle up. in their lap. the human must be. so jealous

gooooob morning. it got quite chilly. on our walk. so the human. lent me their earmuffs. all the passersby. complimented. these cozy ears

please find. your entertainment. elsewhere https://t.co/WtTMo935eT

i have successfully removed. some of the tiny lights. from the house tree. i bet the human. has never seen. an indoor zoom. with such radiance

the human. is cheering at the tv. must be. the sports again

i spend. my valuable time. attempting to smuggle. measly sticks. into this household. now the human thinks. they can just. bring a whole tree in. under the cover. of my snoozle. i don’t think so

there is a tree. in the household. i went to take. my late afternoon snoozle. and i come back. now there’s a tree.. who approved of this. i didn’t. is this. one of many? what depths. does this tree army reach. where is the human. i have questions

gooooob morning. did you know. that if one sits. very well. and looks up at the human. with a straight face. the human will be forced. to stay home. an extra few minutes. and give attention

remember. when that leaf. fell on my noggin. and i became emperor. of the yard. well.. even though. the leaves are done falling. i want to clarify. i haven’t yet. relinquished the throne

i. have been on skittle watch. all day. and guess what. it hasn’t moved. i almost. grrborked at it. in frustration. but i’m afraid. it could. retaliate

it’s movie night. once again.. the human’s fren. came over. the human built their first fire. and i helped. make the pupcorn.. the whole gang. is snug on the couch. including. my stuffed fren. sebastian. who always falls asleep. before the film. even starts

the human. stayed home today. to work on the surprise. in the garage. they let me take a peek. because it’s actually. a surprise. for my fren. and i’m very good. at keeping secrets

the human says. there are two options.. inside or outside. but if they would. elevate their mindset. they would uncover. a third option: stand. in the doorway. and sniff the air

the human came home. and immediately. started making. all sorts of commotion. in the garage. my fren and i. wanted to help. but the human said. what they’re doing. is a surprise

bentley. listen closely. you got this https://t.co/DmjWmCQa2E

let me tell you. about. my stuffed fren. sebastian.. he is. my sidekick pal. and i take him everywhere. he has the floppiest ears. and a long skinny snoot. his arm fell off once. but the human fixed it. he always agrees with me. unless i’m wrong. and without him. i’d be lost

gooooob morning. i found a button. and decided to swallow it. but before i could. the human jumped on me. from like. three rooms away. i guess. this particular button. means a lot to them

the human gets. quite passionate. about the sportsball. on the tv. i usually. bork in agreement. to support them

hi. i have some big news. but it must. remain secret. according to my fren. very soon. everything. will be attacked. by little lights.. a tree. will grow. inside the household.. the rain drops. will get fancier.. and one morning. we open boxes. that contain. your wildest dreams

i. had a nightmare. that the boing sproings. behind the doors. came to life. and started chasing me

my fren. is already snoring. kind of impressive. in a way.. he took the afternoon walk. very slow. stopping to smell. everything he could. i spent that time. wrapping the leash. around the human. as many times. as possible

i always. make sure to say. goobnight. to my stuffed fren. sebastian. even though. he never says it back.. everyone. should be wished. a good night

the human. bought a device. for my bowl. that forces me. to eat slower. do they not understand. that eating at an extreme pace. is the one thing. i truly excel at

gooooob morning. my stuffed fren. sebastian. and i. are on skittle watch duty. until the afternoon snooze. the skittle. i speak of. is under the fridge. and hasn’t moved. ever.. but one day. it could. and that is why. we watch

there’s. a single chair. that the human. told me. i’m not allowed on. why is it special? no idea. but of course. now i want to snooze on it. very bad.. i will slowly climb up. one limb at a time. and hopefully. no one will notice

the human’s fren. is over. once more. they let me. sit in their lap. for a long time. and they played with my ears.. it doesn’t seem like. they have a pup. of their own.. that’s ok. i can be. their pup too

the human. stayed home. today. you know what that means? snuggle. marathon

let me. recap the evening.. i met a ton. of people. who acted. like they knew me. then. i sat under the big table. pleading unsuccessfully. for a snackum. until i found. the seat. of a small human. who was willing to share.. overall. an exhausting day. the night snoozle awaits

gooooob morning. there are already. so many smells happening. today. has potential

i know. how scary. bath time can be. so whenever. the human showers. i make sure. i’m also. in the bathroom.. for solidarity

i think. what’s really important here. is that. i love you

gooooob morning. the human. is off. to do. whatever the human does. and i. am off. to try to fit. my entire foot. in my ear

gooooob morning. a lot happened. on our walk. this morning. i found. a perfectly good waffle. in somebody’s trash. the human. didn’t let me. have it though. there was also. a very frightening. leaf tornado

i. am cuddling. with my stuffed fren. sebastian. and the human. is cuddling. with me.. does that mean. the human. is cuddling. sebastian?

time. is speeding up. don’t believe me? i used. to eat dinner. before it got dark. now i eat dinner. as it’s getting dark. checkmate

one day. kronos. one day. that record. will be yours https://t.co/wbARHYPov9

so you know how. my bed. was shrinking? well. it has remained. pretty much. the same size. for many many snoozles now. perhaps. it’s done shrinking

ok. all is well. the human. came out and almost immediately. found sebastian. mostly. i am grateful. but also. the human. didn’t need to show off like that.. sebastian seems. unharmed. but i think we’re done with. leaves. for the day

i have misplaced. my stuffed fren. sebastian. in the leaves

gooooob morning. my stuffed fren. sebastian. and i. are going to play in the leaves now. it should be. a grand time

whenever. the human. makes a snack. my fren and i. will patiently wait. to be given. a part of said snack. even if we’re not. as long as. the human feels. guilty about it. mission accomplished

it is movie night. and the human. and the human’s fren. are cuddling. on the couch. i will sit at their feet. and stare at them. until. a spot is made. in between them. for me

quick life hack: sticks. are too big. to easily smuggle. into the household. try a woodchip.. thank you. for your time

“while. the human’s away. the dogs. will play” no sir. my fren and i. protect this household. very seriously

i. had a nightmare. and i guess. the human heard me. because now. we’re both. all snugged up. on the floor

sometimes. if a treat. is on the line. i’m asked. to sit.. one last good boy test. but i’m usually. so excited. i can only do. several half sits. i think. those should count

i’m sorry i haven’t. shared my thoughts. recently. i was asleep. and when i wasn’t. i wanted. to be

the human. went out. with their fren. but accidentally. left their coat.. i have turned it. into a blanket. the smell. of the human. somehow makes it. cozier

my day. isn’t too busy. after the midday snooze. i have a meeting. with my stuffed fren. sebastian. about the power. of peanut butter.. also. it’s almost my shift. to watch the skittle. under the fridge

the human. just refilled. our food bowls. thinking that. they forgot to feed. my fren and i. this. is a magical night. second dinner. rules

sometimes. when i’m in need. of attention. (which is. always} i locate. a shoe. take it. and trot by the human. it may take. multiple passes. before the chase. but it never. ever fails

i want. a crown https://t.co/XnwXewF7NN

gooooob morning. we took our morning walk. in between. the bursts of rain. BUT. the leftover tree droplets. were still. quite powerful

the human. accepted the sock. and puppreciated. my honestly. we agreed that. i’d need to be monitored. outside. for a bit.. as for my fren. i lent him. my stuffed fren. sebastian. to snuggle. for the evening

after much thought. i have decided. to come forward. regarding. the hole situation. i will. at the same time. return a sock. to the human. that i stole. a long time ago. hopefully. that helps my case. somehow

the human. got mad. at my fren. because a hole. was discovered. in the yard. but it wasn’t my fren. it was me. i don’t know why. i dug it. but it felt good. at the time

goobnight. to all. and to all. a goobnight

signs. of maximum excite:

2. quick. spinny circles
8. leaps (all kinds}
5. feets. a tippy tappin
c. sustained zooms
1. tail thuddles

sometimes. when the human. isn’t home. i go. to the top of the stairs. and drop my ball. then i race past it. and catch it. at the bottom. i do this. until the ball wins

my fren. is all snuggled up. on the couch. with the human. that’s ok. i have my stuffed fren. sebastian. to keep me company.. all aboard. snoozetown awaits

gooooob morning. my fren and i. found the perfect stick. on our walk. we took turns. carrying it home. BUT ONCE AGAIN. we were denied entry. by the human. until we let it go.. may we meet again

my best trick. is the sit. unless we’re on hardwood. then i excel. at the sit and slide. right now i’m working. on a new trick. it is. not taking. seven naps. in one day

i think. that was the last. of the little monsters. what a night. i received. many noggin pats. and spider-man. gave me. a hug

there are little monsters. at the door. they are allowed. two pieces. of candy. and three. noggin pats. the candy. can of course. be swapped. for more pats

the skittle. under the fridge. that might be. an m&amp;m. still hasn’t moved.. but do not worry. i’ll let everyone know. if it does

i was carrying. my stuffed fren. sebastian. around earlier. and his arm. fell off.. i kept him calm. while the human. performed surgery. i’m proud to announce. sebastian. is whole again. and doing wonderfully

the human. got me. a sailor hat. so i could be. a ship captain. for the party. tonight. this is appropriate. without me. this household. would veer. way off course

a bunch of monsters. have entered the household. i can’t even recognize. my own human. everyone. is rather frenly though. a skeleton. scritched my ear

noah. listen very carefully. you. got this https://t.co/LoH1ZzFU2b

the human believes. they lose their socks. in the washing machine. but oh no. i steal them. way before that

snackum.. has been slipped. first to me. then to. my fren. the life is good

the human’s fren. came over. for dinner. this is the final test. if they. slip a snackum. under the table. they are welcome here. for eternity

i hear. a borking. in the distance. this means. i too. must bork. so that everyone knows. i heard. the initial borking. it’s common courtesy

gary. (the squirrel. i named. gary} was just way up. in that tree. next second. he’s in. this other tree. then. he’s over here. then over there. it is becoming. very clear. that gary. {the squirrel. i named. gary) has cloned himself. what seems to be. many times

every night. i make sure to tell. my stuffed fren. sebastian. what we have to do. the next day. because. i always forget.. this. is a bad plan. because sebastian. never remembers. either

wet leaves. don’t crunch. this is. absurd

gooooob morning. it is raining. but the human. was late for work. so i didn’t. have time. to jump. in the puddles. don’t worry though. later today. those puddles. won’t know. what hit em

i’ve become. quite fond. of the human’s fren.. as soon as. they came over tonight. they got on the floor. and let me. tackle them. with my love. i then. winked at my human. to indicate. my pupproval

i have. no plans today. i rescheduled. the meeting. with my fren. about how to prevent. indoor zooming injuries. because. that’s boring

today. is a snuggle day. please set aside. some quality time. for snugs

alright. let me tell you. about our adventure. it started. with a car ride. windows down. tongue out. the whole bit. i swallowed. a sizable bug. but didn’t let that. stop me. we arrived. at a big puddle. the fren and i. did a splish splash. and now we’re home. it was delightful

THE GARAGE DOOR. IS OPENING. MY FEETS. ARE TIPPY TAPPIN. THE HUMAN. IS HOME. IT IS. ADVENTURE TIME

gooooob morning. the human promised. to come home. early. today. that means. adventure time. is coming. the tail is blurry

i want. to wish you all. the goobest. of goobnights

i tripped. going up. the stairs today. fell snoot first. it wasn’t pleasant. my solution.. ban. every stair

the human. has made mountains. out of. the fallen leaves. it is. quite clearly. my destiny. to jump in them

gooooob morning. today. i’m giving. my new stuffed fren. sebastian. a household tour. he will get. to see. everything. from the human snoozle chamber. to the skittle. under the fridge

please. remember. to perform. at least three. goobnight noggin pats. before the night snoozle. it goes. a long way

the human thinks. i won’t get excited. if they say. doubleyouayellkay. instead of. walk. but guess what. i am excited

today. i tried to eat. a fruit roll up. but the human. stopped me. and said. that wouldn’t have been. in my. best interests

earlier today. the human said. that without. my fren and i. they would be nothing. and now. i can’t sleep. because that’s. a lot of pressure

ok. so it turns out. i was lying on him. this whole time. please set. the household alert level. back. to very light grey

i. have misplaced. my new stuffed fren. sebastian. this is not. a drill

we just got back. from the best walk. ever. my fren. set the pace. i found. a delightful stick. and it was. just chilly enough. that we would hurry. to the next spot. where the sun. broke through the trees

let me. set the scene.. the human. is holding my paw. sebastian. is snuggled up. under. my other paw. and the fren. has already commenced. his dream zooms. the night snoozle. fast approaches

earlier today. a complete stranger. told me. that i am very good. my tail. is still wagging

my favorite. leisurely. activities:

4. snoozles
c. indoor. sun bathing
1. snugs (two person. snoozle}
3. admiring various. sticks
3. walks. with breaks
• outdoor sun bathing
9. staring at. the skittle
d. loving you
2. letting the human. rub. my ear. to a john mayer song

the best part. about. my new stuffed fren. sebastian. is that. he listens. not only. to my problems. but to my dreams. my goals. my ideas. for example.. peanut butter leashes

i have. BIG news. remember the package. from earlier. that i protected. so well? turns out. it waS FOR ME. ALL ALONG. i now have. a new stuffed fren. he has. a super long nose. little mouth horns. and tremendous. floppy ears. i will call him.. sebastian

I HEARD. A KNOCKEM. AT THE DOOR. AND WHEN I INVESTIGATED. I DISCOVERED. A PACKAGE. JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR. I WILL PROTECT IT. UNTIL THE HUMAN. RETURNS

gooooob morning. i had a nightmare. that. both my ears. were inside out. and then i sprouted. a third ear.. guess what. also inside out

unless. it’s top secret. and involves. covert pupperations

sometimes. the human. will lift up. my ear. to tell me something.. this is. completely. unnecessary

sometimes. when we play catch. with the human. i let my fren. get to the ball. first. he’s not as speedy. as he once was. but he still deserves. the boundless joy. that comes with. a good fetch

today. i ate a leaf. not because it tasted good. but because. the crunch sound. is addicting

i used. to throw up. during car rides. but now. i don’t sometimes

sometimes. i wish. the human. needed a hug. because secretly. i do

do not worry. keno. soon. you will zoom. again https://t.co/O0TxgkbVso

gooooob morning. my schedule. is unusually clear. today. only one meeting later. with my fren. about whether the skittle. under the fridge. is actually. an m&amp;m

this is. hey. look at me. this is very. hey. eyes please. the following. is very important.. i love you

last night. in the middle. of the night. my fren. grrbork borked. signifying. a household alert level. of dark grey. i immediately. did my standard surveillance. and found nothing. when i returned. to the fren. he had already. recommenced. his snoozle

the human’s fren. is over again. we’re not on good terms. at the moment. they need to learn. how to share the human. and understand. that i was here. first

just woke up. from my. mid-afternoon snooze. which takes place. after the midday snooze. but before. both the early dusk power snooze. and. the night snoozle

gooooob morning. may your zooms. be speedy. and your tail thuds. echo with love

i for one. am more than ready. for the night snoozle. but first. a recap. of my day.. gary. (the squirrel. i named. gary) hurled an acorn. that i dodged narrowly. but dodged. nonetheless. then. i checked on the skittle. under the fridge. as. you may have guessed. it hasn’t moved

on one paw. i enjoy. lying in the sun. it makes me feel. not only cozy. but also. magnificent. on the other paw. puddles are fun. and splish splashing. is my passion

the deal. with the human. is that. for every good dog. they see. in the book. they have to also. tell me. i’m. a good dog
https://t.co/CJdjDCOo9B

the human stared. at the tv. for so long. i don’t think. a smile occurred. all day. i just chewed. the remote. to absolute bits. you cannot hurt. my human. anymore

my ear. covered my eye. for a second. in that moment. i. was already committed. to my new life. as a pirate

the human. just gave. the fren and i. the biggest hugs. they’ll be late for work. but i don’t think. they care

i. was lying outside. minding. my own business. and a single leaf. fell. from the tree. and landed. on my noggin. i am now. emperor. of this yard

the fren. has told me. about this time. of year. apparently. the leaves. turn all shades. of muted yellow. and soon. the tiny humans. transform. into monsters. but even they. in their spooky state. still get to eat. chocolate

the human left. to go hangout. with their fren.. that’s fine. everything’s fine. i’ll just be here. working on my. very important dog stuff. and contemplating. my own. replaceability

if you hear. a single bork. and then. absolute silence. that was me. testing the acoustics. of the household

gooooob morning. last night. i. had a dream. that i dug. a hole. in the yard. and found a treasure chest. in the chest. was peanut butter. today. i see if my dream. will come true

GUESS WHAT. there is now. more room. for me to tell you. all about. my day. so. sit back. relax. and enjoy. my existence.. it all started. with my morning stretchem. this was quickly. followed by. an inherent goodness. sweeping over me. and blessing. everyone. in the vicinity

alright. here. is the deal. i support and love you. til the end. of time. and you..... give me. that cheese stick

I’VE GOT. BIG NEWS.. i love you

human. cleaned up. all my toys for me. i know. it’s only because. their fren is coming over. and they want to. appear responsible. but still

it used. to take me. several attempts. to summit the couch. now. one leap. and it’s. game over

i stole. the human’s sock. and they didn’t even. chase me. i guess. they’re not. in the mood. i was only joking. i always. give it back

what would i do. with more characters? well. i could tell you. all about. hoW TODAY. I DID A ZOOM. SO SPEEDY. MY EARS FLEW BACK. IT WAS AMAZ

if i. don’t win. it’s rigged https://t.co/YL3WPpR6aZ

gooooob morning. i snuck. a stick. inside the house

i. am watching. a movie. about a bee. on the couch. with my fren. the human. and the human’s fren. who is also now. my fren. too

showed the fren. how to do. the front paw cross. in case. he's ever feeling. particularly fancy

WE. ARE OUTSIDE. THE HUMAN. IS THROWING THE BALL. VERY HIGH. THE FREN AND I. JUST RUN. IN ONE DIRECTION. UNTIL WE HEAR IT. HIT THE GROUND

all. the good boys. know. when to sit

petting me. with your foot. only counts. as half a pet

sometimes. i let the human know. i need to go out. but then. i stand. in the doorway. and just. sniff the air. this. annoys the human

fren. and i. were both doing a tug. on the same. toy. obviously. i let the fren win. because i. had already had. a long. and tiring day

i. will get one. for my human. so they know. they miss me https://t.co/HgTarMU5ES

the snoozles. they have. consumed me

the night snooze. fast approaches. do not forget. the triple noggin pat. indicating. sweet dreams

gary. (the squirrel. i named. gary} thinks. he's so cool. running along the top. of the fence. and such. i could do that. if i wanted to

i know. i already said. goobnight. but the human. made. a night sandwich. and forgot to drop. a piece of cheese. that. is against. the law

i wonder if. anybody. reads these. thoughts of mine. that'd be. rather embarrassing. oh well. goobnight. i love you. big time

i used to fit. so snug. on my bed. now at least. one feets. hangs off. at all times. there is only one. explanation. the bed. is shrinking

my fren's face. is grayer than. the rest of him. this could only mean. one thing. he. is a wizard

sorry. for the lack of. thoughts yesterday. my life is normally. a confined. magical. ever-changing odyssey. but not yesterday. i just slept

my fren. fell asleep. on me. his head. is lying. on my stomach. which makes me. incredibly aware. of my own breathing

i took. the morning walk. a little slower. today. thought about. how happy i am. alongside. my fren. and my human. the life. is good

the human. who snuggled. my human. the other night. is here again. BUT. this time. however. they brought. my fren and i. treats.. we approve

the human. came home. smelling like. another pup. i've never experienced. such an intense. betrayal

WE WENT. ON A WALK. BY THE RIVER. THE HUMAN. THREW SOME BOUNCY ROCKS. INTO IT. THE FREN AND I. PLAYED TAG. I WISH. YOU COULD'VE. SEEN US

human. promised. they'd come home early. and take. my fren and i. on an adventure

the day. has been completed. off to snoozeland. i. love you

i once. tricked the human. into thinking. my tongue pops out. every time. they touched. my front left paw. until one time. i forgot to do it

there is. another human here. cuddling close. on the couch. with my human. i. will forcibly. create a space. between them. for me

i. accidentally. stole some paper towels. and decorated. the household

the first time. the human brushed me. i thought. i was. falling apart

i. will go to. incredible lengths. to make sure. the sun shines on me. while i snooze

the morning walk. was very wet. i jumped. in a puddle

the human. did not have. a good day. i. will go get. my finest ball. for them. it always makes. me happy

my. daily commitment. to you. is that. something important. will be knocked over. by my tail. when i'm excite

sometimes. i drool. incomprehensible amounts. it's not. on purpose. it just. sorta happens

the human. fell asleep. on the couch. between me. and my fren. it is. the coziest. of pup sandwiches

today. i stole. an entire. avocado. took the human. several house loops. to take it back

the human. brought frens over. one of them. forgot to pet me. as they entered. that individual. has 30 seconds. to rectify. the situation

i grrrborked. at the hurricane. on the tv. it did not. do much. i apologize

being. as good. as i am. day in. and day out. is quite. strenuous

i was dreaming. that i was. zooming. through watermelon fields. and accidentally. kicked the fren. waking. us both

i've been working on. some combo moves. for instance. the tap tap bork hop. that one. is pretty. self explanatory

i remember. when i was. addicted to. the sproing boing. wall toy. behind the door. now i walk past it. and scoff. for i am better. than it

i drank. all the water. in my bowl. earlier. but just now. i returned. to the same bowl. and it was. full again.. the bowl. is haunted

today. my only goal. is to not. get stuck. in the bathroom

my favorite. pastimes. include:

7. the snooze
• stick reviews
2. staring at. the skittle
3. zoom tutorials
b) loving you
2. peanut butter

the human. has found me. thank you human. yes everything's fine. i don't. really. want to talk about it. i need. my space. for a bit

what if. i never see. the human again? what if. i never play. with my fren. again? what if. i never. lick peanut butter. off a spoon. again?

i have. been trapped here. for an estimated. 9 days

there seems to be. an elaborate. water bowl. which will prove. useful. in due time

i'm not sure. why. i came in here. in the first place. oh well. this is. my new home now

i trapped myself. in the bathroom. don't ask. how it happened. now. i'm just sitting here. waiting for. helicopter evac

when it comes. to the sports. i try. to mimic. the human's. reactions. i must support. even if. i have no idea. what's happening

if i. am sleeping on you. you cannot move. it is. the law

gary. (the squirrel. i named. gary} is slowly tapping. on the window. with an acorn. he is staring. through my soul

i only bork. at my reflection. to test. my own. reflexes

sometimes. i fall asleep. easily. other times. it's like. let me think. all the thoughts. i've ever thunk. real quick. i want. peanut butter

some toys. were big. AND. very chewable. you see the problem. i encountered

i spent. all day. organizing my toys. from biggest. to most chewable. it didn't go. as well. as i'd hoped

i found. such a nice stick. on my walk. this morning. carried it. all the way back home. but was denied. entry. until i let go. of it

the fren snores. sometimes. and i think "i too. am trying. to snooze over here. buddy." but i don't say it. because i'm not. bold. like that

i would like. to kindly. request. a lengthy. snug

early morning walks. are for. practicing. fancy trots. and prances

sometimes. i will. bork up the household. for no reason. at all. a practice run. if you will. for when the house. actually needs. borking up

if. my tummy. is rubbed. at 207 or more. rpms (rubs. per minute}. i lose. any and all control. of back legs. hence. the swift air kicks

i've been staring. at my fren's ears. all morning. they stick. straight pupwards. regardless of. level of. excite

everyone. is talking about. this fight. when they should be. talking about. me

ME. AND THE HUMAN. AND THE NEW FREN. WENT. ON A HIKE. AND WE SAW. OTHER FRENS. AND I JUMPED. IN A BIG PUDDLE

wow. a whole day. just for me

many say. how good. i am. few. account for. how good. i will be

new fren. stole. my socks. that i stole. unbelievable

gary. (the squirrel. i named. gary} isn't as confident. when outnumbered

i think. it's time. i tell you. that i love you

fren and i. just went. on a tandem walk. it went well. the leashes. were only tangled. the whole time

my new fren. just caught his tail. first try. i. am astounded. like whoa. show me. the wise ways. wise one

i. am a:
 
⚪️ koala
⚪️ jungle. tortoise
🔘 puppo
 
seeking:
 
⚪️ noggin pats
⚪️ passionate boops
⚪️ permission. to zoom
🔘 all of. the above

the new fren. enjoys. mid afternoon. snoozes. as well. this is. delightful

my new fren. and i. are getting along. we alternate. borks. for maximum. protect

skittle watch. went well. nothing. too crazy. occurred. did i miss. anything?

grab. a writing. utensil. immediate. i've got. big news. i love you

the new fren. is older. than i. but his zooms... they are impressive

i just realized. i'm not. the only. good boy. in the household. anymore

we are on. our way home. an extra tongue. is hanging out. the windows. don't worry. i still have. the front seat

it turns out. i want. every dog here. to be. my fren. stay tuned

i have. selected. my new fren. time to. convince the human

my human. is taking me. to see dogs. that don't have. humans yet. i've always wanted. a fren

tomorrow. is going to be. a good day https://t.co/qkESa6rQdZ

i'm learning. that the silly human. already bought me. some fancy glasses. for some reason. they clearly. didn't check. my schedule

everyone. is worried. about my eyes. when the moon sun thing. happens. but my whole day. is booked. staring at the skittle. under the fridge

the human. is always sad. after watching. the tv. so i hid. all the remotes. i could find

i'd slide. across. a million. hardwood floors. for you

i have been. programming. my human. every time. they give me food. i borkf. eventually. every time. i borkf. they will give me. food

can't sleep. thinking about. peanut butter

i am. cuddled close. with the human. but they still feel. far away. i. will cuddle closer

i am available. for pets. if anybody. needs them

i have. been working. on my tree climbing. skills. all morning. gary. (the squirrel. i named. gary] has no idea. what's comin

i am. the best guard dog. like. you can't slip. by me. unless you pet me. and tell me. i'm good. then. you can. usually pass. quite easily

every dog. is looking. for a human. to love 
https://t.co/mqEQO6ieST

the tired. has come. big snooze. awaits. before i go. please note. i love you. s'much

do not worry. if you forget. about. my constant need. for affection. i will remind you. with many nudges

things that make. me happy. that might also. make. you happy

4. a good stick
3. long hugs
8. unexpected food
2. zooms
5. love. reciprocated

WE WENT OUTSIDE. AND PLAYED. WITH THE BALL. i was hesitant. to give it back. after i got it. but. i had to. to keep playing. IT WAS SPLENDID

the human. turned off the tv. then lied down. beside me. i don't think. everything. is okay

ok. let me summarize. we went. on a big walk. to some water. that i splish splashed in. then. we walked back. it was. dare i say. magical

HUMAN. CAME HOME. NOW I AM IN THE CAR. FRONT SEAT. WINDOW DOWN. TONGUE OUT. IN THE WIND. TO WHAT. DO I OWE. SUCH A PLEASURE

human said. they could be home. from. wherever they go. a little early. today. and we will go. on an adventure. the tail is blurry

i collected. all of my. tennis balls. and did an experiment. how many. could i hold. in my mouth. at once? turns out. one. i will improve

reporting live. from. the couch. mid. afternoon snooze? i think so

you cannot. spoil me. if i already. deserve the world

i'd buy. a boumcy castle. i heard. they're fun. and shoes. aren't necessary. which is cool. because i. never wear shoes. anyway

i think. i'd be very. irresponsible. with money. so i'm glad. i have none

gary. {the squirrel. i named. gary) hurled an acorn. that hit me. square. on the noggin. this morning

human. gave me. an extra long hug. followed by. direct eye contact. these are. undiscussed signals. but i think. we're on. the same page

i didn't think. i'd have. to say this. again https://t.co/51pJhp82FV

my time. it has come https://t.co/DRVqUmMHqo

i promise. (pawmise. if you will). i don't mean. to always lie down. in the most. inconvenient places. it just. kinda happens

it. is raining. the outside. is wet. i will. hold it. until the sun shines. across these lands. once more

all aboard. to snoozetown. first stop. i love you

i've. gotten bigger. but the human. has always been. the same size. at this rate. i will soon. control the household

i would like. your attention. please... not because. i'm about. to say something. important. i just like attention

when i'm. an older. established pup. i will live. a life. of luxury. sandy walks. by the big pond. i can see it. now

i'd say. i'm fairly. aerodynamic

in case. you didn't. hear it. yet. i love you

if i am. overlooked. i will notify. the human. via a series. of discreet borks. the offender. will be removed. from the house. immediate

human. is having. a get-together. tonight. i will sit. politely. by the front door. awaiting. all the head pats. and chin scritches

sometimes. i feel bad. about sleeping in. then. i remember. my responsibilities. are minimal

between. laying down. in many different places. and waiting. for the human. to come home. i. was so productive. today

no no. you do not. simply. stop petting me

every time. you shake. my paw. a contractual. agreement. is formed

we're going. on a night walk. this is big news. i get. to wear. my flashy jacket

you ever. wake up. in the middle. of the night. and think.. why?

alert. breaking news. i love you

you say. 'whoa dog. how do you. eat. so fast." i say. "what was. my time. i can surely. go faster"

you. can measure. my love. in tail thuds. against the floor. per minute

a rule. i live by. is. if the crack. in the door. is shnoop wide. or bigger. i am entering

correct me. if i'm wrong. but. i think. i would like. a hug

boops. not nukes

a new week. is upon us. or so i am told. human. time constructs. are confusing. i prefer. to break it down. into snoozes. and non-snoozes

how about. i only. use it. when i'm sharing my thoughts. and chasing my tail. at. the same time

i! have discovered! a new! punctuation! not sure yet! what it means!

gary. [the squirrel. i named. gary} is staring at me. through. the screen door. as if to say. "bring it. young doggo"

i. am on the verge. of the snooze. just wanted. to mention. that i love you. like. big time

it took me. so long. to cover this house. with my love. and you just. vacuumed. it up

i have been. in an elevator. twice before. i can't believe. they build. a whole new room. while we're in. that box

sometimes. i grrbork. at the sky. in case. anybody. is listening

good luck. jax. i hope. you zoom again. soon https://t.co/JYhnV7Nkdl

the human. just hugged me. extra hard. not sure. what i did. but i can snooze. soundly now

some days. i wonder. if i deserve. all these noggin pats. other days. i know i do

mornings. are usually. pretty open. for me. good sit over here. lie down over there. not. too busy

human. is sad again. two licks. on the hand. only a single pat. in return. i. will do better

top. annoyances:

5. gary {the squirrel. i named. gary)
h. leash tangles
2. inside out. ear
2. fragile sticks
a. the hardwood
9. Keith Urban

sometimes. a drool occurs. without. provocation. one of. the greatest mysteries. of our time

had. a mid-afternoon. run in. with gary. (the squirrel. i named. gary] he is well. and remains. elusive as h*ck

noise. has awoken me. possible sources:

2. world ending
d. no other. possibilities
5. definite apocalypse
3. wake. the human
a. immediate

i want. to. race a shark

told the human. we need. a costume. stat https://t.co/GCKcAbeepS

i. am not happy. when the. attention. is dispersed

the. best walk. just occurred. saw like. 23 or 6. other dogs

excuse me. i just wanted. to. remind you. that. this love i have. is for you

just. lost my human. i borked. and borked. turns out. they were just. in a different room. alert level. back to green

just. woke up. from an unplanned snooze. and forgot. who i was. for a second. you know those snoozes

i. am exhausted. but. do not worry. loving you. is low effort

half. of this story. isn't true. i. can't talk yet

a stranger. told me. i was a good dog. today. i was like. you don't know me. though. then. they said. you can talk?

gary. {the squirrel. i named. gary) uses trees. to his advantage. i too. must learn. this tactic

did someone say. game of bones? if so. if i may. i would like. to play

i. have been staring. at this skittle. under the fridge. for several eternities

good luck. mingus https://t.co/XIliiLoMe4

i practice. my fancy walks. (skips. gallops. trots. et cetera} when you. are away. they're not good enough. to show you. just yet

noise. has been neutralized. by that. i mean. i haven't. heard it again. snooze time. once more

i. have been awokened. by a noise. must inspect. must resist. urge to bork up. the entire household

i thought. they only offered. gray? https://t.co/kbJhNH5f1m

i sit. then i'm like. "no feets. where are you going pal?"

petition. to stop. my back feets. from sliding away. when i sit. on the hardwood floor

if you sit. on the floor. i. have to climb. in your lap. that is. the law

do not. forget. the goodnight noggin pat

'jump." is aggressive. i am. a docile being

i. do not. "jump.' on the couch. i spring. gracefully

it is morning. birbs. are chirping. sun. is shining. gonna be. a great day

things. that make me. smile:

5. sticks
f. my human
2. water {solid state)
2) good pats
b. overthrowing. the patriarchy 
1. long snoozes

one thing. i do. super well. is making sure. you know. of my presence

i feel dog. in this chili's. tonight

what if. people. are actually. reading these. that would be. so embarrassing

when the human. isn't home. to distract me. that is when. i think. my deep thoughts

good morning. frens. i hope. you boop a shnoop. today

i can't. sleep. thinking about. what gary. [the squirrel. i named. gary} is up to

today. i defeated. the sprinkler

rumor has it. if you. pat. and boop. a dog. at the same time. the dog. will duplicate

i'm. just a dog. doing my best. to love you

WE WENT. TO THE PARK. THERE WERE OTHER DOGS. PRESENT. SNIFFED SOME BUTTS. WRESTLED. A LITTLE. not too much i'm sensitive. IT WAS WONDERFUL

leaving for. the car ride. now. i will tell you. all about it. when i return

i. slept in. super late. to puppare. for the car ride. the tail. is wagging s'fast

the human said. we could go. on a. car ride. tomorrow. when he gets home. and i'm. so happy. I cannot snooze

pet me. like. one of your. good boys

please. respect my human. if. you do not. i will. bork you up. on previously unseen levels

gary (the squirrel. i named gary] is entirely. too fast. for me. i'm sad that. i can't catch him. but respectful. of his speed

it is. important. to note. how good. i truly am

i absolutely. deserve. some good pats. after all that

alright. you guys have. 2 hours. max. of the sky boom. nonsense. any longer. and there will be. a puprising

human invited. all the frens. over. one of them. is bound. to drop a hotdog

poured. some water. out of the bowl. for koko. also requested. a walking cart. for my birthday. not because i'm old. but because. i'm lazy https://t.co/BapgY3v07n

love is love. is love. is love. is love. is love. is love. can be petted. and booped mid-stride. fill the world. with pups. far and wide

the walk. included. a brief swim. this morning. i haven't. stopped smiling. since

cut it out. with your. premature sky booms

you ever. have a good yawn. but. halfway through it. you think. you might. get stuck? mouth open. super wide. forever

a borkf. occurs. when i'm not. fully committed. to a bork

i'll. tell you. about being happy. if you. tell me. how rainbows. make you feel

sometimes. i doubt. what my puppose. is. then the human. smiles at me

remember. to. pet dog. tonight

my shnoop. cannot reach. this tennis ball. under the couch. i. will lie here. until someone. remedies. the situation

snooze. you lose? please. a snooze. is always. a victory

today. is the day. i catch gary [the squirrel. that. i named gary) optimism. is key

good morning. frens. i. just did. quite the stretchem

is a dream. really a dream. if. it isn't. about. peanut butter?

my. most fancy. tricks. sorted by. difficulty:

3. snoozing
9. sit (a classic}
b. trot/advanced walk
2. The Fetch
3. roll
e. zoom (speedy)

when. a sad occurs. take a snooze. then. pet a dog. me.. preferably

did. a little trot today. like regular walking. but advanced. onlookers. were impressed. I know it

henlo. it's me. i love you

i try. to make sure. the house. is neat and tidy. for when. my human comes home. some days. this is. an unrealistic. expectation

i will grr. if i sense. a danger. i. will grrbork. if the danger. is confirmed. usually. i am wrong. about what is. and what isn't. a danger

if. i'm hangin. with you. and my ear. is inside out. you better inform me

"love. is complicated." bullocks. just pick. somebody. and love them. for instance: i pick. all of you

my zooms. are improving. i know this. because. pics of me. are getting blurrier

a pat. on the noggin. is worth. two. on the belly

when. in doubt. bork it up

sometimes. when i drink. water. i wish i had. a straw. like you. fancy hoomans

good luck. shadow. fren https://t.co/M8rejPaydf

do dogs dream? one. may ask. the answer? yes. you h*ckin bet mate. about what? says another. peanut butter. and. reciprocating love

pick. something to appreciate. once. every hour. don't worry. it can be me. more than once

i. will nudge you. so much. then act. like. it's something. besides attention. that i need

up late. thinking about. all the toys. i hid. then. forgot about

if i. lick your face. it means. you're doing. amazing

frens. i have news. i'm in love. with the fine floof. across. the way

THERE. IS THAT NOISE. AGAIN. TIME TO. RUN AROUND. THE ENTIRE HOUSE. BORK IT UP. TO PROTEC

apparently. the "best.' is unreachable. when all the dogs. are equally. perfect

i've decided. that today. i will surpass. 'good." and be. the best

you bet. i'm snoozin

goodnight. everyone. if for some reason. you forgot. i. love you

GUYS. i just. had a morning walk. almost. caught gary. (gary is. a squirrel that. i named gary} the life. is good

you ever. want. something. so bad. you'd give all. your tennis balls. for it? that's me. right now. with watermelon

one. small pet. for doggo. one giant boop. for pupkind

remember. to touch. a dog's ear. tonight. 2 days. of good luck. guarantee

snoozes. are. so good. like wow

i. am. a strong proponent. of:

c. wags (good. ones)
2. cheese
III. invading spaces
7. stick
4. quests
7. peanut. butter yes
b. speedy zooms

will someone. take me. over the big water. so i. can join. the polling station. fun?

i. just want. to share. all my happy. with my human

i. love you. i love. you. i love you. *licks mirror*

if i. enter the room. without knocking. i can assure you. it is. very important

key. to my heart? the biggest. stick. in all. the land. just kidding. you already have. my heart

i. am now. entirely. in the lap area. to the top. of the priorities. i go

human. is sad once more. i. licked the hand. and nothing

when. i smile. on my back. and my tongue. hangs out. THAT. is living

just did. an inside zoomie. ears back. and everything

can i get. two pats. and a. ric flair

click. the tweet 

ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤif. you love me   
ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ

it is early. i am awake. who. knows why. maybe today. will. be extra good

so. so sorry. i forgot. to share thoughts. over. the weekend. i'll summarize:

2. STICK
f. SQUIRREL
8. FOOD
1. NOPE. STICK AGAIN
b. snooze

very. very tired. today. exhausted. from being. so perfect. all the time

my tail. just spooked. me greatly

bacon. ball

hear. me out. a tennis ball. covered. in peanut butter. then wrapped. in bacon

ok. but here's. the thing. i love you

still some. sadness around. i. can feel it. BUT. i will just. give the human. double. the attention. to make up. for it

can i. have a piece? https://t.co/8eruPSh8J9

i. love stories. i always. pretend to follow along. but sometimes. i get distracted. thinking about. peanut butter https://t.co/R29SkIvHcU

my human. is sad again. i can tell. because. he only gave me. one pat. when i. put my head. in his lap

i. get sad. when it rains. because. my zooms. are contained. to the indoors

good dogs:

4. lick
3) sit. sometimes
g. borkems
1. rollover (advanced)
3. eat things
a. zoom well
VI. know their. roman numerals
6. love

it is late. but i'm up. thinkin bout. what makes. ice cubes. so special

yes. i have to work. on weekends. if by work. you mean. being. so good

i guess. i could share. our secrets. here? but i don't think. anybody sees these. except. the blue birb

dogs. we have. figured out happiness. if we. could talk. we'd tell you. all about it

morning frens. today is good. i can. feel it

the louder. i smack. my tail. against the floor. as i lay. on my side. the more. i love you

just got. a lengthy chin scritch. from my hooman. i'm. on top. of the world

stressed? have a relax. take. deep breath. pet dog. repetition. is key

but. i don't. have a car https://t.co/sKPV07MEEf

i will. make it. impossible. to ignore. my presence. licks. borkems. nudges. tackles. i'll do it. all

i. am walking. this is good. perhaps great even. the sun is warm. stick in my mouth. i will. trot now. because i'm so happy

I. AM SO SICK. OF. just kidding i'm pretty. content right now

i. circle an area. before. laying down. to show. the area. i know. my shapes

'don't. snooze your life. away." ha. what a life. that would be

i'd. pet me

give. a mom. a hug today. say it's from me

at the end. of the day. all. that matters. is the amount. of peanut butter. one. has consumed

i. borked a bit. sniffed him thoroughly. turns out. he's also. a very. good dog

another dog. has entered. my residence. i must. preserve the homeland

where. is. my hat. i'll be addressing. my hooman soon. about this. injustice https://t.co/mLepVraAQc

hi. me again. i love you

good boy? check. great boy? checkmate. the best boy? perhaps. one day

Quinn. do not worry. i will share. my hips. with you. if the goal. is not met https://t.co/cs3Kw6gVQN

please. don't lint roll. my hair. off of you. that. was a gift

in my opinion. which i value. puddles. are the best thing. that exist

squirrels. are so fast

listen. closely. i need the following:

•pats (noggin-bound)
5. watermelons
1. all the sticks
b. a left shoe
12) another pat
5. a gameplan

i. can't sing. but if i could. i'd never stop

do not. i repeat. DO NOT. take. my ball. only throw

good. night. don't let. the bed bugs. bamboozle

a thing. to remember: good things. are good. BUT. bad things. are not good. i think

i. think i'd make. a good. fbi director

what if. what. if. people see them? oh man. should've thought. about that

every time. i hit the blue button. when i've. completed. my thought. I get nervous. i. don't know. where my thought. goes

i. just woke up. from an afternoon. snooze. stretched so big. yawned. thrice. i love you

dogs. good because:

9. soft
d. warm yes
4. we zoom
• we bork
4. but only. to protec
a. soft
2. we love
7. we listen
b. we love. some more

another day. another dollar. just kidding. i have. no money

sometimes. i cross my front legs. when I lay down. to feel. fancy

i'm awake. right now. i can't sleep. thinking about. what might be. out there. past. the great yard's edge. more peanut butter. hopefully

a boop. a day. goes. a long way

one thing. you should know. about me. i. do not put up. with the loud sky booms. or accompanying. sky flashes. no sir

snooze? affirmative

henlo. i cuddled. with my human. all night and. i hope. he feels better now

goodnight. frens. i love you. but you already. knew that

sometimes. i steal. socks and other valuables. solely for attention

i did this. got a brief smile. and two. noggin. pats. thank you https://t.co/6BbWCcqeHz

my human. is very. sad today and. i don't. know what to do. he won't respond. to my presence

snooze time. once again. frens

i barked. so loud. the noise has not. reoccurred. take that. noise

I HEARD. A NOISE. i am awake. ready to. confront. the source of. the noise. wish me luck

oh me? i'm just. a good dog. doing good things

GUYS. GUYS GUYS. i found. a slice of cheese. under the couch. nothing. can ruin. this day

i greeted. my human. so well. this morning. got several pats. for my services

LIKE HOW. MANY ACORNS. YOU. GOT IN THERE. DUDE

why are we. obsessed with squirrels? secretly jealous. of their. cheek capacity

i chose. the picture. with. the watermelon. because in that moment. i've never. been happier

mid. afternoon snooze? you betcha

the sun. is up. the tail. is a waggin

i. was so good today

care to. spare a pet. or two?

if. you partake. in the partying tonight. do not forget. to look. for the dog. in the house. and give a pat

do you ever. think of peanut butter. and 4 hours pass? me? that happens. twice a day

it is early. but i must tell. you. i had a dream. that my tail. was wagging. and when i woke up. it WAS

very late. for this pup. to be up. just wanted to say. i love you and. i mean it

today. has been so good. let me tell you. a piece. of watermelon was. sneakily offered to me. under the table. i took. full advantage

tonight i will dream. about Meeko. and him doing. super zooms. in the yard. forever https://t.co/bVIBIxQ0Be

i know. it is. a little late in the day. for a brief snooze. but i've had. a terribly long day. please excuse. the snooze

perks of. being dog:

3. no taxes
a. pets
• belly scritches
7. zooms (fast ones)
7. occasional swims
d) snoozes
1. peanut butter off. spoon

goodnight pals. friends. and companions. remember to. love thy dog

wow. just chased the tail. unsuccess. room a spinnin. worth it. please pet to stabilize

all the fuss. about dogs. and them being good. is very justified

good ones https://t.co/wIcIauDKsp

i don't know. much science. BUT. i do. like the planet. march on

i. will not stop. until. my belly is rubbed

i am. awake and ready. to be good

carefully https://t.co/KZsNCZyEfb

i. must apawlogize. my phone died. and it took. 24 hours. to get the thing. in the wall and. attach it to my. phone. no thumbs is hard

big day tomorrow. must be off to snooze. but guess what. i love you

one time. i was on a walk. and i saw a stick. so i picked it up. and carries it all. the way home

we do. high level calculus. actually https://t.co/QrzXl87Bbu

i'm not. very rebellious. but i would like. the mug. to feel included https://t.co/eizBQ861iA

GOOD MORNING. the sun is up. just had. a good walk. can't wait to. see what else happens. today

goodnight everybody. remember to give. a dog. a firm noggin pat. before bed

why. am i crying. in the club. right now. i don't even know. how i got in. a club https://t.co/W3rPmJoSXy

dogs. should never be sad. or sick. or lonely. that's just. a personal opinion

there are. a lot of smells happening. at the moment. please humans. be generous with. the causes. of those smells

everything. is better now https://t.co/8RiKyzLWSV

my efforts. to find every egg. successfully. have gone woefully unnoticed. i thought. i did well

i found. all the eggs first. but the candy inside. was quickly taken from me

i'd like you all. to focus. attention. away from bunnies. and back to me. thanks

lots of things. are happening. but deep breath. remain calm. pet dog. second deep breath. i love you

guys. guess what. i just took a nap. and now i'm awake

you're not a dog. and stop using. periods. incorrectly https://t.co/zZWUOzuxK8

good friday? please. make it. good boy friday. then we'll talk

i have. a headache

girls. can be good boys. too? listen. i don't make rules. boys. can be good girls. goodness is universal. gender is irrelevant. all is good https://t.co/XAPJFmbHAX

hi. i caught a bug with my tongue. like a gecko. thought i'd share. highlight. of the week

come. meet me and Jonny said. you could pet him https://t.co/nZGj5U3jIV

i hope. your dreams. involve bacon. mine. most certainly will

it is midday. not much. goin on. just wanted to say. i love you you're doing great

mornings. are bad. because doing things is hard. however. one must persevere. to achieve the next. afternoon snooze

i have come down. with a serious case. of hicpups

i heard. it is pet day. i humbly request. that you pet me. all day

hello everyone. today. i swallowed an acorn

i just finished. the long snooze

i hope. your day was great. if not. wag tail. continue on. just life

hi. this morning. i woke up. and my legs were tangled. took me a minute

retriever? please. barely knew her. BUT yes i retrieve: sticks, balls, toys of any kind, rocks if they're shiny, frisbiss, sticks, peanut bu

what breed am i? two words: an awesome one. i say this. because i don't see breeds. just good dogs

it. is nap time. only wake me. if it's important. like peanut butter

my best guess. is like 2 feet. maybe. BUT. keep in mind. i've never confirmed it https://t.co/crUZcSpjYA

i... have some research to do. please excuse https://t.co/PX43uawSEP

it is late. i know. and i'm sorry if i wake you. with my knowledge. what if. i'm called a pet. because. now get this. you pet me.   woah

obviously. if you're sneaky. taking the dog with you is an option. BUT. please remember. to return

tonight. at the party. locate the dog. give a pat. leave

fun trick. you can use any vowel: scratches. scritches. scrutches. scrotches. scretches... and i still want it done to my belly

a serious message. to my peers: how are you doing today i love you

*thanks* https://t.co/91FiXkvOrA

another thing. you may not know. about me. is that I'm soft. and extremely susceptible to pets

it is a good morning. why? one may ask. because. i received a firm pat on the noggin. already today

let me make. myself. very clear.. i love you

here's a thought: cheese. that i have access to

ATTENTIONS: i caught my tail. time for. a new life goal

what is that sound? me. being the best

i. have never cried harder https://t.co/NSeey7Ladf

do not worry. i say. because sticks exist. and that's awesome

nothing. like a good dog. in the morning

heylo. just wanted to say. i love you

to all. who question my good boyness: how dare you

time for the sleeps. cannot wait to be. a good boy. again tomorrow

these. are the things i know

1. barks
b. rolling and similar acts
6. being excite
2. patience (sometimes)
ë. novice tongue tricks
2. love

here's. here's the thing. i stole your Chick-fil-A pickles out of the trash

i'm thinking about peanut butter. again

people are playing tricks. and i am not here for it

...h*ck https://t.co/h2delcA8SH

GIVE IT https://t.co/ujsinlITBk

i am not a fool. do not joke today. i will not fall for it

it is night. time for the snooze. remember i love you

ice cubes excite me. why? you say? even i do not know

what is love? baby. don't hurt me. nom nom

SNOOZES. are also good

i want it on record. i advocate naps. dozes. and sleeps of any kind

late night post. i love you

sometimes. my tail wags before i know what i'm excited about

goodnight. i hope your day was good. and your tomorrow is better

sometimes. when i'm sad. i think about peanut butter

i have an itch. it needs a scratch. however i cannot reach. somebody please

wonder why there's no jail for dog? no bad dogs. no jail required

do a favor. pet a dog today

i must sleep now. for it is exhausting being so good

the best part about a belly rub. is the rub on the belly

sometimes. i forget my tail is there and it scares me

i have seen the stats. we are become too powerful https://t.co/qsZWp5nHCA

i have awoken and i love you

it is sleep time. i was good today again. at least that is what I was told

to be dog? or not to be dog? wasn't my choice. but i'm glad i'm dog

a big misconception. is that dogs don't like hugs. counterpoint: i like hugs

sometimes i eat the food too fast and throw pup though

another thing. that is good and not bad. is food. most would agree

naps. they are very good. i support them

some say. dog life is easy. no worries no taxes. i say. walk a mile with my shoe. which reminds me. i took your shoe

today. will be good. like me

today i was a good dog i think. tomorrow i will do just as good. if not improve

when i am before wall. i wonder. what is beyond. more watermelon? unlikely. so i go about my day https://t.co/intQlVs3wJ

in my mouth. is a watermelon. it is there because i want it to be

what is cool about dogs like me is that. we enjoy pats on the noggin. same is true for most dogs

dogs are good, yes, BUT... something to consider. we are also great
