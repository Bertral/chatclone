Open Message to Goonswarm Federation Concerning the Blackout
Hello zkillboard. I am Naz al-Ghul, professional war journalist and the envoy of all the bad Goon posters on this subreddit. I want to talk to you about the upcoming blackout.

The Mittani (pbuh) has accepted that CCP will bring PvP to Delve for the first time in a generation. Only the old guard remembers a time when Delve was a refuge of squatters and... eugh... EVE Online players. But I digress.

The Mittani (pbuh) has 100% told me to tell you all this. Mass PvP is encouraged and allowed in Delve. In all actuality, you must PvP against your fellow goons. Awoxing is now legal. Do you hate the Romanians for cherrypicking more than an underpaid farmer smuggled into the country in a Shop-Rite truck? Dreadbomb their Rorquals. Do you think we should kick ASCEE? Do the job yourself with your three Titan alts. Do you believe we should never have moved our supercapital fleet out of D-W because you at one point bought a Bhaalgorn and drunkenly declared yourself the King of the Sun as you open fired upon anyone who warped towards your heavenly domain? Use those same Titan and Supercapital alts to blast the Keepstar in 1DQ to smithereens.

Everything is permitted. Even 1337. Anime is legal. PvP is legal. Go forth, for the next great cultural revolution has begun.

We Surrender
With all that's happened in the past few days, we in the Imperium never expected this development. All of our ore, mineral, and PI stockpiles we've harvested over the years to help manipulate the markets in our favor, all of the community investment in our Titan and Super program, our unparalleled SRP program, we've carefully harnessed these to become the greatest alliance EVE Online has ever known.

That changed when the Drifters attacked.

As you all know, Fortizar after Fortizar has fallen to the Drifter menace. Our fleets? Wiped out. Our leadership? Deposed. The Mittani (pbuh)? [He's watching horse races while dressed like someone who won too many games of Monopoly to cope with the sudden death of his years-cultivated empire.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D9VlTGJW4AAZEJ9.jpg)

I want to send this message to the Drifters and to CCP and to all of our enemies: We Surrender. It's over. You can have our Citadels and our PvP fleets, just please for the love of God let us mine our spod. It's all I have left.

How Fast Can They Run
Usain Bolt, Hedliner, KillahBee and LadyScarlet were doing stretches on the 200m running track. The day had hardly started, the starlit sky barely acquainted with the sunrise. Usain Bolt was showing them proper stretches, posturing, pacing and giving them advice. Their faces looked thirsty for knowledge, as well as water. This was the most exercise any EVE Player had ever done, but Panfam leadership had decided upon a new hobby: Running.

&#x200B;

"You were all so enthusiastic about coming here," Usain said to this group. "I want to see that enthusiasm on the track. Give me one lap."

&#x200B;

LadyScarlet looked at Usain like he was nuts. She pulled the bangs of her "May I Speak To Your Manager" haircut out of her face and approached Usain amiably. "Could we start out like a beginner?"

&#x200B;

"One lap is what my grandmother does in the morning," Usain replied. "You can't beat my grandmother?"

&#x200B;

"I was hoping maybe like a couple yards?"

&#x200B;

"How many?"  


"One."

&#x200B;

"Get on the track now."

&#x200B;

Verily Usain Bolt was faster than all mortal man. He expected little from the rest of humanity who needed mechanical monstrosities to break the sound barrier, rather than their legs. However, these three were the worst of all of humankind.  LadyScarlet fell to the earth with a mighty crash at the second footstep. Hedliner seemed not to understand the mechanics of running, skipping and prancing a couple yards before collapsing on the ground. KillahBee made it the furthest (having the most experience), but still collapsed before the first turn. Usain dragged the three back to the starting line.

&#x200B;

"I know an elementary school gym teacher, maybe you should start with him?" Usain asked.

&#x200B;

Hedliner and KillahBee looked like they were about to accept the offer, but LadyScarlett intervened. "No! Children are cruel! We'd have to run with them!"

&#x200B;

"Ze children used to make fun ov me in school," KillahBee recounted sadly. "Zey used to make fun ov my trench coat and Battlefield Earth t-shirt."

&#x200B;

Hedliner spoke up, "Look, I'm sorry we're not athletes but we need to run. We've realized something earlier today: If you can't fight, run. And we can't fight. We really can't."

&#x200B;

"Fight what?" Usain asked.

&#x200B;

"Have you ever played video games?"

&#x200B;

"You play video games? God, it's worse than I thought," Usain Bolt shook his head. "MMO?"

  
"Yes."

&#x200B;

Usain nearly shed a tear. "Let me make a few calls. We'll see what we can do to make you the best runners."

&#x200B;

Usain Bolt was gone for fifteen minutes. Hedliner and KillahBee looked between each other, and back at LadyScarlet. Her eyes left her skull, supported by fleshy tendrils, and looked back at them. They looked away, and Scarlet's eyes returned to their sockets.

&#x200B;

Usain Bolt returned. "Hello, I have returned. Before we continue, do you have any questions?"

&#x200B;

"How big is your penis?" Hedliner asked.

&#x200B;

"It is twelve inches, but I have the ability to retract it and my testicles into my body for faster speed. Any relevant questions?"

&#x200B;

They all shook their heads. KillahBee drank some Gatorade mixed with sauerkraut but beyond that they were all silent.

&#x200B;

"I have phoned someone who was willing to help you. He made it here in remarkable speed. I notice you seem to all be afraid. Tiny and scared, like bunny rabbits."

&#x200B;

"I'm not that scared," Hedliner said defensively.

&#x200B;

Usain Bolt looked up gamer terminology on his cell phone and shouted, "LOOK BEHIND YOU, NOOB! A HEADSHOT!"

&#x200B;

Hedliner wet himself in sheer terror.

&#x200B;

"So here is my idea. You are motivated by fear. All of you. So what I wanted you to do was imagine your worst fear and run for it. But it is better to have a physical thing to run from. Behold."

&#x200B;

Panfam's leadership felt a chill so cold their blood nearly froze in their veins. Out of the locker room was none other than the Mittani (pbuh), who wore nothing but a pair of sketchers, socks, and red booty shorts that said "Are You Nasty?" on the butt.

&#x200B;

"Now, when you--" Usain was surprised to see that his trainees were already gone. The Mittani (pbuh) gave chase of course, but the Jamaican people saw the four fastest white people that ever set foot on their lands running. LadyScarlet and Hedliner were fast, but KillahBee was the fastest one of them all. When they ran out of island to run on, Panfam Leadership ran on the top of the ocean like human basilisk lizards. They would run, they would flee, and into the ocean they would pee, but they never stopped running from the Mittani (pbuh).

A Brisc Resurrection
Brisc Rubal slammed the hardwood door shut and cried out in fear as dragon's fire whipped through the cracks between the door and its frame. He thanked God that he was able to run so fast; what if his suit got damaged?

His attention turned to the blonde muscular man closing the eyes of his fallen comrade. "We'll meet again in Sovngarde, brother."

Ralof's thousand-yard stare pierced through Brisc. "Looks like we're the only one who made it. That thing was a dragon. No doubt. Just like the children's stories and the legends. The harbinger of the end times."

"I thought Jesus was--"

Ralof raised his hand and pointed over to the corpse. "May as well take Gunjar's gear... he won't be needing it anymore."

"No, I'm fine," Brisc said. "I was born in this suit and it grew with me as I became an adult. I've never had to change my clothes, because I bathe by throwing myself in a washing machine and a dryer."

Ralof stared at him with the macabre intensity of a wide-eyed corpse, until Brisc politely stripped the dead man naked and pretended to put on the Stormcloak armor.

Brisc was given a sword, which he used to hack a bunch of... Roman soldiers? to pieces. He had no idea what was going on. Ralof was ranting about Elves in an uncomfortable way as they fought through spiders and more soldiers. Murder came naturally to Brisc as he dug his blade into the neck of an aged Imperial Officer. He licked the blood off of his lapel. It tasted like a Unicorn's semen, or more interestingly to Brisc, a backroom deal with a US Senator.

However, no matter the taste of blood and satisfaction of war, Brisc desperately wanted to go home. Although, was there a home to come back to? If he came back to life, his family would disown him. A lobbyist who got caught doing something wrong was banished as a warning to the others. He didn't even do anything this time! CCP Games blamed him for violating an NDA, and he hardly had the time to deny the allegations before they crucified him--er, cut his head off.

"Hold up! There's a bear just ahead!" Ralof called out to Brisc. However, it was not a bear. And after arcs of lightning cut through the air into the Stormcloak, there was no Ralof either.

Standing where the bear would have slept in Tutorial Cave was a hermaphroditic dark elf with golden pottery on his head. His tits bounced like two water balloons. He was barefoot, but his 4k resolution boots sat at the corner of the room. His three foot long penis was covered by a tabard.

"Who are... what?" Brisc gasped in horror.

"I am Xenuria," said the figure, opening his arms as if to beckon Brisc closer.

"You're behind this?"

"No, but I can reap the rewards," Xenuria said. The cave shook like a battered cruiseline, and Brisc tumbled to the floor. He looked up to the mouth of the cave, once illuminated with sunlight, now only glowing red as the eye of Alduin stared in. 

"What do you mean? You betray the Imperium by doing this!"

"I have done nothing. You see, what I employed was basic psychology. I *knew* Sort Dragon and Killah Bee wanted you out of the picture. I could have stopped them." Xenuria's erection stood arrogantly before Brisc. "But why would I?

"I will instead step in to seal the power vacuum. Imagine PLNC and their little Starscream Sort Dragon actually doing anything successful. I will take back the CSM, and I will make every character look like mine! I will sell CCP to Linden Labs, and every ship will finally be pink!"

Brisc picked up his sword. "Not without a fight!" He swung down at Xenuria, but even with his triple-D breasts and the ass of an Olympian, Xenuria was dexterous enough to dodge out of the way and kick Brisc Rubal. The lobbyist crumbled to the ground after his body peeled itself off the wall.

"That's funny. You think you can kill me here. I've been modding Elder Scrolls for a long time my friend. I'm a god here. Do you really think you can kill a God?"

"...Anything is... possible..." Brisc coughed.

"What a grand and intoxicating innocence." Xenuria pulled out a tape recorder, and hit the record button. "Now throw down your weapons and surrender your seat to me, it's not too late for my mercy. I will make this world a futanari paradise. Lydia with a penis? You can't go wrong with that. Renounce and falsify the Christian god and give me the CSM!"

Brisc didn't have faith in the Christian god anymore. Jesus had failed him when he needed Him the most. Now his reputation was in tatters and faced either death or Xenuria's oddly desirable sex world. However, he knew that he had to rescue the real world from Xenuria. He put his faith in the one who never failed him, and picked up his sword again.

"You are the weakest God I've ever seen," Brisc said.

"Can you substantiate that opinion of yours in a rational debate with me?" Xenuria asked. Alduin's maw pushed into the cave.

"I don't need to debate. I know who the real God is. It isn't Jesus. It isn't Allah. It is the one who has never failed, even when all is lost. He who survived the wedding of Remedial. He who was also wrongfully removed from the CSM. He who had walked the halls of presidents and kings, whose presence compels those leaders to bow."

"What are you--Oh no," Xenuria conjured up a massive fireball.

"MITTENS TAKE THE WHEEL!" Brisc smashed his fist down where his faith commanded him to.

He hit tilde, and then console command killed Alduin.

Xenuria struggled to move, slowly succumbing to the frozen state of time. "The console c-command?!? How?! You don't even have a keyboard! What sort of Deus Ex Machina is this?!"

"I don't need a keyboard when the All-Knowing Mittani (pbuh) pushes all the right buttons," Brisc said.

"Don't get cocky, I have a keyboard! I have tilde too!" Xenuria hit tilde, however he now completely froze in place, and began to disintegrate. "W-what?"

"I knew you would do that," Brisc said, smirking. "While you were dumbstruck by how powerful I am with faith in my Lord, I rewrote the game to be the Playstation 3 copy of Skyrim. Modding is forbidden. The both of us are now banned from the PS3."

"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO," Xenuria shouted. He, Brisc, and the whole of Skyrim disintegrated, until they stood in the CSM headquarters, between Steve and CCP Enis.

"Oh, great," CCP Enis said. "I'm glad you're alive! I don't know how you survived the beheading or why you have a sword in your hand... wait I have a few ideas as to why you have a sword in your hand. Look, for what it's worth we're really sorry about what happened. We didn't *know* we didn't know. And as Donald Rumsfeld said, the worst unknown of all is unknown unknowns, right?"

Brisc looked at Sort Dragon and Killah Bee who cowered in the corner, fearing punishment at his hands. CCP Enis seemed to almost wet himself in fear of what was to come. Brisc felt powerful. He felt like the congressman he always wanted to be.

"We'll even give you your seat in the CSM back!"

Brisc thought about it. He then pulled out a shortbow and shot CCP Enis in the knee. "No, I'm fine. Thank you. Give me my account back. I'm going to Delve to mine out 1DQ in 20 unaligned Hulks like the good old days before the Rorqual. I don't need the CSM. The CSM needs me, but I need me-time with my wife. And Lydia, my housecarl."

Brisc Rubal walked out of CSM Headquarters a new man. He felt as if he had died and was born again, and said as much to his friends. This was the beginning of a new holiday in the Imperium, where Easter would be celebrated every April 25th in commemoration of The Brisc Resurrection.

A Brisc Twist
[(Continued from this)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bb1g8f/a_brisc_end/)

&#x200B;

CCP Enis sat in the smoke filled room with CCP Robert Mueller and a lawyer named Steve. Steve was used to consulting game developers. Game developers were accustomed to erroneous lawsuits and threats of litigation over minor in-game concerns because fat neckbeards were emotionally unstable if anything in the game the devs made went wrong. Usually, this was solved with a brief consultation and a drive back to his office with a lovely sum derived from the consultation fees.

&#x200B;

Usually.

&#x200B;

"Gentlemen," CCP Enis began, stirring his Mountain Dew Code Red and Mountain Dew Cold Shock together into a lovely shade of lavender within his goblet. "I'm worried about something. Brisc Rubal's estate has raised concerns about the eligibility of our decision and claimed that we acted... too hastily."

&#x200B;

"What did this Brisc Rubal do?" Steve asked.

&#x200B;

"He released information that was only given to him through the conditions of a Non Disclosure Agreement. We take these things very seriously. We permanently removed him from the CSM, and then CCP Mueller executed him with a scythe."

&#x200B;

Steve blinked. "I beg your pardon."

&#x200B;

"It's how we ban people from the game."

&#x200B;

CCP Mueller dragged a whetstone along the blade of his scythe. "Beware the old blood."

&#x200B;

"Okay. Murder. I'm not aware of Icelandic laws on that. I presumed it was illegal."

&#x200B;

"Oh, Iceland's only worthwhile cultural export is EVE Online."

&#x200B;

Steve started to feel a deep sadness for Iceland, as he knew enough about EVE Online to avoid it. Most of his lawyer friends played it, and he hated lawyers.

&#x200B;

*"Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy." Lokir sneered at Ralof. Ralof's lack of response only incensed the horse thief further. "if they hadn't been looking for* ***you,*** *I could've stolen that horse and been halfway to Hammerfell. You there."*

*Brisc Rubal looked up, still in a daze. He went to brush off his suit, but realized once again he was bound. "Yeah?"*

&#x200B;

*"You and me--we shouldn't be here. It's those stormcloaks that the Empire wants."*

&#x200B;

*"We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief."*

&#x200B;

*"Shut up back there!" shouted the Imperial soldier. Brisc let out a scream. The Imperial soldier looked exactly like Killah Bee.*

&#x200B;

"Murder aside," Steve desperately moved the topic back to the investigation. "You all seem to be very concerned with the legitimacy of your ban. Where did you first learn about Brisc Rubal's violation of the Non-Disclosure Agreement?"

&#x200B;

"We were told by the Council of Interstellar Management," CCP Enis replied.

&#x200B;

Steve beamed. "The what?"

&#x200B;

"The Council of Interstellar Management."

&#x200B;

"Are you... trying to be funny?"

&#x200B;

"Maybe he'll know what you're talking about," CCP Mueller offered, "if you called it the Council of the Splendorous Mittani."

&#x200B;

Steve pretended to look thoughtful. He shot back, "No it **really doesn't.** Is this a legal body?"

&#x200B;

"No."

&#x200B;

"A private investigation team?"

&#x200B;

"No."

&#x200B;

"Then what in blue blazes is the Council of Stellar Management?"

&#x200B;

"A group of a dozen players or so that were elected by the players to talk to us."

&#x200B;

"So you listened to them. EVE Players."

&#x200B;

"Ayuh," CCP Enis said, pretending to be from a Stephen King novel.

&#x200B;

"Did they conduct an investigation?"

&#x200B;

"No."

&#x200B;

"Did you conduct an investigation?"

CCP Enis' brow creased. "...What?"

&#x200B;

*"Ulfric Stormcloak, Jarl of Windhelm."*

&#x200B;

*Ulfric stepped forward. No cowardice existed in this man. Nord blood flowed strongly through his veins. There would be no running; only fighting, or Sovngarde.*

&#x200B;

*"It has been an honor, Jarl Ulfric." Ralof's solemn words only confused Brisc Rubal. Who the hell are these people?"*

&#x200B;

*"Ralof of Riverwood." Ralof stepped forward in the footsteps of his king.*

&#x200B;

*"Lokir of Rorikstead."*

&#x200B;

*"You're NOT GOING TO KILL ME!" Lokir made a run for it. At the call of a commanding officer, a hail of arrows fired at Lokir, which caused him to clip into the ground and launch into the sky.*

&#x200B;

*When it finally came time to address Brisc, the Imperial soldier Hadvar furrowed his brow in confusion. "Captain, what should we do? He's not on the list."*

&#x200B;

*The Imperial captain, who to the surprise of Brisc, looked exactly like Doomchinchilla, spat back: "Forget the list. He gets the block."*

&#x200B;

"So you're telling me that you publicly defamed a man whose real life name has been tied to his account, accused him of committing a crime, summarily executed him, and you never conducted an investigation."

&#x200B;

"Well, just because the investigation may or may not conclude that Brisc Rubal committed a crime, it also would not exonerate him," Mueller said.

&#x200B;

"I really think it would," Steve shot back. "Start the investigation now please."

&#x200B;

"This is going to take about a week," CCP Enis groaned.

&#x200B;

"For the investigation to complete?"

"No, for the support ticket to be acknowledged."

&#x200B;

"Well, it's like my rabbi always said," Steve advised, "The best time to have started something was a week ago. The second best time is now."

&#x200B;

"Those are wise words."

&#x200B;

"But you really should've done this sooner, you fucking assclown."

&#x200B;

**TO BE CONTINUED**

The Landlords of War
Android 69 fled his third floor apartment just in time to avoid the damning blast of a rocket smashing into his window. He ran past the gym nobody used that came free with their rent, and took great pains to mind the pieces of glass on the floor where a pack of lactating tittyraptors lept into the building and mauled the child laborer who maintained the gym equipment. Android 69 felt bad, though not quite as much as he should've, because he held the opinion that the child was overpaid for his work.

He hit the floor and army-crawled to the exit, glancing up to watch the glorious Asher Elias riding a genetically modified dolphin (which had the limbs of a horse) into the building leading a swarm of bees. His first victim was a babushka who loved to plant flowers in the snow. Asher's Dolphin Horse dove into her mouth and let loose its ultimate attack: it peed Mountain Dew into her intenstines until she exploded.

Android 69 finally made it outside, carrying nothing but a mercifully undamaged T1 Rorqual in his briefcase, just in time to watch as the nearby dam was blown up and his home was washed away in a massive flood.

So it goes.

"What a tragedy," I said, reloading my rocket launcher. "The Malpais Estates Apartment isn't a safe place isn't it."

"What's your angle, goon?" Android 69 snapped.

"Well," My tongue turned into a snake and snapped up a Russian mouse that survived the aftermath of this assault. "Have you looked at a no-kill animal shelter on fire and asked yourself, 'how could this benefit me?'"

"...No?"

"Oh. Well, Malpais doesn't appear to be too safe. Being honest, you could've done much better with your choice of rented livingspace."

"Yeah, but where would I go? I want to be far away from the Goons that always kill me and make fun of my penis for being the shape of a Starscream toy from Universal Studios."

"That's an oddly specific shape but I can help you. Have you ever considered... wait," I fired my rocket launcher at the short bus that read "Malpais Estates Apartments Refugee Vehicle," and everyone slowly turned into furries, and the short bus turned into a giant furry which lustfully vored everyone that was inside of him. "Period Basis is up for rent. All anomalies and systems are available."

"That sounds interesting," Android 69 mused. "Wait, that's REALLY close to Goons right."

"Yeah it's our space."

"But I want to be far away from the Goons."

"You'll be far away from the Goons that kill you. Everyone near Delve only knows how to use a Rorqual and a Titan, and they can't use it on our renters."

"Are they bots?"

"No, Goons don't bot in Eve. We bot in Old School Runescape, a far more successful MMO with richer lore, to pay our EVE subscriptions where we play the game in accordance to the EULA."

"That's a good deal. But how much does it cost?"

"One billion a month for new renters."

"I'll have to give it some thought."

"My posts don't have a part two, take the deal or I'll tackle you and the tittyraptors will motorboat your corpse."

"Okay, I'll rent!"

---

Android 69 made a great deal with me, and now lives a life of luxury in an ice belt in his T1 Rorqual, never again to be bothered by another player. Do you want to live the life of luxury like Android 69?

Let's make a Deal in Period Basis! Call 1-800-CONTACTSADUS for your chance of a lifetime!

A Brisc End
The grim faces of the CSM members did not even wince when the squirming, screaming garbage bag hit the floor. In it, the pathetic victim poked small holes into the Hefty bag to let the measly light into his sack of void. The room was mostly black, with one ghastly spotlight barely lighting the room and revealing its occupants.

Innominate continued to sip his wine glass, which was in reality a mixture of every soda sprayed from the machine at the local McDonalds. Sort Dragon wiped some brown stuff off of his reptilian snout and glanced disdainfully at their captive. Killah Bee finished docking up his faction titans and Germanly disregarded the dignity of someone in his captivity. The Judge sharpened his knife. Jin'taan pined for relevance, hardly paying attention. Suitonia was absent, playing EVE Online. I never heard of Steve Ronuken so he doesn't exist. Merkelchen left the room to herd cats. And Aryth?

Aryth was the darkness that the light could not banish.

This was the room I entered, followed by Asher "60 Jumps Home" Elias, Hero of Asakai Dabigredboat and Junior FC Kendarr. I rushed in, drew my katana (folded 69,420 times by Vegeta Nobunaga himself) and sliced open the bag.

Brisc Rubal was there, wearing nothing but a suit and tie just like the day he was born.

"What is the meaning of this?" I asked desperately I spoke with my most convincing voice (which is Japanese dub, with English subtitles popping up in the air in front of my torso). "Is he not a member of the Council of the Splendorous Mittani (pbuh)? Does he not spin his ships five times a day as our Prophet demanded of us?"

"It is not your right to question the Imperium, citizen," said Innominate.

"With all due respect dear Handsome Stallion of Inner Peace and Potent Penis," I replied, "As Supreme Inquisitor I have a Lowtax-given right to one question every ten years."

"It is allowed," said Aryth, whose voice emanated from the stars. We all went mad then, and peed on Brisc while we sang an Irish independence song for five minutes. 

We regained our senses. Sort Dragon leaned in, his serpentine head allowing him to stare us down without actually leaving his seat. "Brisc Rubal is charged with sharing confidential information about EVE Online, and selling that information."

"So?"

"For in-game wealth."

Every self-respecting member of the Imperium grimaced, and Sort Dragon followed along subserviently, for the Imperium only plays EVE ironically.

"Have you reported this to CCP?" Boat asked.

Kendarr fired an AK-47 in the air. "CHECK CHECK. HEL ON GRID. OIGHT YOU PRICKS I NEED CAPITAL DISCIPLINE."

Everyone promptly ignored Kendarr, who jumped into the Hel on his own.

"I'm too busy to report him," said Suitonia, losing six Kestrels a second. "But Jin'taan was going to report him."

"Maybe then people will pay attention to me again," Jin'taan cried desperately. "Like the good old days when I was in Provi."

"Before we report him," I held up my hand. "We need to find a way to do so without hurting... The Narrative."

Every Goon nodded sagely. Killah Bee was lost, as he never knew a narrative in his EVE career or any narrative that roused a significant amount of people since before 1945. Jin'taan only agreed to have friends, and Sort Dragon didn't really know how to read all that well and didn't know what I meant by narrative.

"How do we frame this story?" Boat asked.

"Herr Boat, can always just sprechen he zold it to the Hordelingz," said Killah Bee.

"Say that he was a pro-warp stabilizer candidate who betrayed the Imperium who hated stabs. Then all of lowsec will like you!" Suitonia said. "All six of us!"

"But I love stabs," Judge said.

"Not backstabs," everyone in the room replied.

"Oh." He sat back down in disappointment.

"Call him a traitor to the United States," Innominate said. "The FBI could take care of him before CCP does, covering up the whole story."

"But who would believe that?" Asher asked, using Lincoln logs to divine his next fleet trajectory. "Isn't he an important politician in the US government?"

"Actually," Brisc spoke up wearily, having spat out his gag. "I'm a lobbyist."

The room went as silent as a graveyard.

The CSM and their Goon overlords voted unanimously to turn the lobbyist over to CCP Games. CCP sentenced him to permanently win EVE, the death penalty.

We watched from afar, as Brisc Rubal knelt down in a field of white flowers. He heard footsteps behind him: The replacement for CCP Guard had come to be his executioner. That's right. US Special Counsel Robert Mueller. He carried a scythe longer than his body, a crescent as grim as a stormcloud and as cold as the moon. He leaned down behind Brisc, and whispered, "Farewell good hunter. May you find your worth in the waking world."

The scythe sang as it cut through the air, and Brisc Rubal was no more to all of us.

Brisc Rubal's vision went black for a time. Then, the world faded into view. It was no longer the nightmare from which he came. He saw pine trees and snow-quilted mountains. He was startled and looked around and found he was in a rickety cart, pulled by some kind of anachronistic soldier. He looked around, steadying himself as the cart rattled with every rock the wheels hit. He didn't really understand where he was. All he understood was that he was in a cart pulled by a horse, and he was bound like everyone else with him.

"Hey, you," said one of his fellow passengers. "You're finally awake."

EMERGENCY DECLARATION
I have turned in my report to the Special Council of the Black Hand. It has been a long investigation and many Goons died screaming loudly into their highly-sensitive microphone, but theirs is a sacrifice I was willing to make.

I am the Supreme Inquisitor of the Imperium. I have a job to do. It is a thankless job, publicly masturbating in front of thousands of people browsing Reddit in the name of a coalition that literally cannot be defeated no matter how hard you try. However it is a job that needs to be done.

Olmeca Gold has been charged with an array of anti-citizen activity in Delve.

1) Olmeca Gold is charged with unauthorized PvP in Delve. As you all know, PvP is illegal in Delve. We have strict gun control laws in the regions we control. Our guns are only sanctioned to our citizens to hunt Blood Raiders, our national delicacy when cooked with fava beans paired with a nice chianti. You can't bring guns into Delve. It is illegal.

2) Olmeca Gold is also charged with revealing state secrets. The EVE Online subreddit has been admittedly under Imperium control for the last few years without so much as a whisper of discontent. Your rabble rousing is a sign of your malignant recalcitrance.

3) Affirmation of the Armenian Genocide is forbidden. This never happened. There is no such thing as Armenians.

4) You are finally charged with six counts of Conspiracy to Kiss Girls. You may have never kissed a girl, but I have sensed a desire in your heart as you violated our laws. You've lusted for the fairer sex, rather than staying in the light of the Mittani (pbuh) and reveled in the sexual phenomena of being the lover of a broad-shouldered lumberjack with a heart of gold and a beard mightier than your willpower to resist his desire. This by itself is worthy of life imprisonment.

It is with a heavy heart and heavier hand that I declare a hunt against Olmeca Gold as he rampages heterosexually through Delve. Anyone who racks up five or more kills enters a raffle. If you win the raffle, you will get a Hel.

Signed,
Supreme Inquisitor Naz Recep Tayyip Erdogan al-Ghul bin-Delve

Shark Week is Over
You heard me. This is the last straw.

I am a victim of a vicious hate crime. Yesterday, I was minding my own business and acquired the artist's inspiration. A fae mood to be sure considering how insatiable it was. I locked myself in my dojo which does NOT (despite my neighbor's insistence) smell like corn and smegma billowing out of the windows like smoke stacks from the factory. I spent hours working on it, fussing over every detail, until I finished my illustration which I consider to be one of my best:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[The Stealth Bomber](https://i.redd.it/75glw683wih21.jpg)

I call it, "The Stealth Bomber." I took special pride in myself for the detailing on the Nemesis, though I admit that I need to work on my Hound. It just looks too much like a Pod Racer.

Of course, this isn't just a drawing. Rixx Javixx can draw. *I* created *art.* The r/eve community was abuzz with discussion over what this meant. Someone posited that this might have been a drawing of a Bomber's Bar fleet, but the piece would've turned out a lot differently if I needed to add so many frigate wrecks. It seemed all was going well in the world.

Then, Jibrish ascended from the depths of Hell and deleted my post.

This is a travesty. This is discrimination. This is the suppression of the arts. I've been reeling ever since. Once I saw my post off of the front page of r/eve, I ran into a CVS and found the nearest baby in a carriage. I vomited on it and screamed "HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME" at the infant as its mother tried in vain to stop the carnage. It took six tasers to bring me down, and I just now got out of jail.

What, forsooth, have I done to deserve this treatment? Especially from one such as Jibrish who has been seen in the same video game as Seraph IX Basarab the kaffir and apostate whose arrogance places himself above the boundless love and wisdom of Allah. One such as Jibrish who has, in a fit of sociopathic glee, forced his wife to sit in front of a computer and try out EVE Online (which I'm pretty sure is a felony in more than a few states) after repeatedly telling him "NOOOOOooooOOOoooo!" One such as Jibrish who is a known apologist for the power liches that run the Northern Coalition.

One such as Jibrish who is a man who *kisses girls.*

I declare Shark Week over. It is a tool of the heteronormative nymphomaniacal totalitarian power structures that comprise the Communist party leadership that has socialized and ruthlessly runs the moderating team of r/eve. General Secretary Jibrish will no longer oppress us, the posters.

I declare a Day of Decadence. I want you all to repost Facebook posts, throw down inflatable dinosaur costume gifs, find completely unrelatable comics and just slap alliance logos onto people's faces to make it relevant. Do not go quietly into the night like the Alliance Tournament did! STAND UP AND FIGHT!

I've been drawing Stealth Bombers all day. I think I've gotten really good at it!


Circle-of-Two is No More
December 2nd, 2018. On the first night of Hanukkah, The Artist Formerly Known as GigX set a live video feed of himself from the ex-Soviet bunker that was his home in the PUBG map known as Serbia. He wore a military tracksuit with the Order of Karadorde's Star on the chest, once glimmering with pride now pale in the humble light of a waning incandescent bulb. GigXY Chromosome wore a sajkaca and a fake handlebar moustache that made him look like an impoverished Hulk Hogan.

"Comrades, I start glorious speech telling that every idea I have is many great and everyone is out to get us," Gigatoni XPasta started.

Automatically, all 2.5k members of CO2 chanted "We are the victims!"

GigglesX continued. "It is with many hate in my heart that Circle-of-Two is many dead, comrade."

A wave of shock hit every CO2 member at their computer. The wailing and gnashing of teeth could be heard almost exclusively from the country of Serbia, which had now lost the only reason why its country had been posted online to begin with.

"I went to Pandemic Legion, because Hedliner now letting refugees in with 25% kb efficiency! He told me no, stabbing me in the back! NCDot refuse too! Many reason unexplained! Angry because bad allies in war! Went to renters, they scared Goons come for them! Even Pandemic Horde won't let us join!"

One CO2 member typed in alliance chat, "How are we not even allowed to join Horde?" Gigabit Xfinity took out his Makarov pistol and pointed it into the camera. The barrel stuck out of this CO2 member's computer screen and fired the bullet, blowing his head off his shoulders.

The dull sounds of gunfire leaked through the cement walls of the bunker. Gigan XFinalWars left the camera to investigate. No one was at the blast proof doors. Gigaton Xenophobia turned back to the creeping darkness that was the rest of his bunker before. His thirdhand computer had powered down while he was gone, and the lone light bulb that never stopped swinging seemed to dim like a dying star. Funny, he thought. It used to be so bright when he lived in Deklein, the rambunctious but ultimately loyal member of the Imperium. The Mittani (pbuh) would be especially stern in His punishments with GigX, but He never wavered in defending the Circle-of-Two. In these last moments, GigX doubted the stories of the Imperium's lack of defense of his alliance, a story that he forced down his own throat as much as his members.

Perhaps he shouldn't have allowed himself to be attracted to women. The candlewax on his back was so much more satisfying when Wibla dripped it on him than Lady Scarlett. There was love when Wibla stepped on him with stilettos.

Maybe he should have stayed with the Imperium.

The light of the bulb was so weak that all that could be seen was GigX, as if he stood in the spotlight of a malfunctioning streetlight. The darkness blinded him to everything. The floaters and flashes in his eyes were all that moved in the pitch black of his bunker.

The light bulb went out.

\---

Meanwhile, in Delve, the stars dazzled, little bears dressed in Dinaric costumes danced along the 1DQ1 Keepstar, groaning short chants as Karmafleet Titans orbited the stargates shooting fireworks at anyone who entered the system. Within the Keepstar, the Black Hand were throwing CO2 refugees into a massive bonfire, Izalis chasing after them to tell them to stop wearing fursuits. Naked linemembers danced around the bonfire, the smell of burning flesh of post-signers, o7ers, and historical revisionists intoxicating us as much as the smoke suffocated us. I stood on a podium wearing Amarr robes and a Fallout 76 Collectors Edition helmet, holding up my robes and then swung my circumcised penis around like a helicopter blade as [holy chants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8njVPJiVC4) echoed through the halls.

CCP Games, enslaved by both a Goon-led CSM and the Republic of Korea, on pain of forced gender-bending vampirism, destroyed the current EVE Monument and constructed a fifty-foot tall statue of Boat wearing his Napoleonic military uniform. The plaque betwixt his thighs reads:

"Jump. WAIT. DON'T JUMP. IF YOU JUMPED, YOU **DIED.** ***NO SRP."***

The Mittani (pbuh) marked the celebration by fighting John Cena in a WWE wrestling ring. The Mittani (pbuh) let John Cena fight well to make it seem like it was a close match, but The Mittani (pbuh) karate-chopped the Commander-in-Chief of Cenation's sphincter and split the man in twain in the middle of performing a Hurricanrana. The crowd cheered.

Happy Hanukkah everyone.

What do you call it when dictor pilots get mad and threaten to bubble the fleet?
**SABRE RATTLING**

My solutions to all of EVE Online's problems
Hello, I am Naz al-Ghul.

As you know, I am a prolific poster on r/eve, and thus I have more insight into this game than the very people who design it and have a specific vision laid out for it. My understanding of game balance is unparalleled by the developers, and your elitist and frankly quite problematic view that my "credentials" "don't exist" as if I need any "qualifications" from "accredited universities or job experience" to have my opinions taken seriously.

The biggest problem with EVE Online is not necessarily the proliferation of capital ships, but with their application becoming far more wide and varied as time goes on. I'm only going to talk about Dreads here, because I hate carriers and fighters. If you pilot a carrier or supercarrier to PvP, your virginity grows back. Slurp your own dick with a vacuum cleaner, I don't want to know anything about your sickening dark arts.

I'm going to be perfectly clear. Dreads should be more expensive and they should be stronger against structures than they are against subcapitals and Rorquals. They should not be the supreme ganking ship. You can tweak your fascist numbers all you want, but at the end of the day, there is only one solution.

Covert ops cloaking device II on Black Ops Battleships, and upping their damage outputs.

I cannot begin to tell you how shit-your-pants insane this could possibly be. Imagine you're this Rorqual pilot, defenseless and afraid. You're not in the Imperium, so you don't have thirty Titans to jump in to save you if Theta can stop shitposting for five seconds, but you're still a Rorqual, and in the eyes of CCP Games and anyone who lives in lowsec who wishes they could mine moons passively again you are worse than  Lord Voldemort being mpreg with Shadow the Hedgehog's child.

Imagine the fear you have when you have three minutes until you can move, and there's an invisible battleship fleet *supported by* T3 cruisers rather than replaced by them, warping around your system and scanning you down. You would shit your pants. Anyone would shit their pants. *I am shitting my pants right now!*

This is my balance pass. I think this will be better than decaying skill accelerators and hole-penetrating HICtors. Don't you?

Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.

March to the Promised Land
Two thousand years ago, the plague of jump fatigue hits EVE Online, and capsuleers cried out unto God through their tears, for this was the end of capital warfare and moveops sent millions of innocent fleet commanders to the asylums. The jump bridges also spread this disease, and now the community was forced to jump through sixty stargates to be destroyed by the slumbering Titans and Supers on the stargates of enemy staging systems. It was torture.

The March Patch was announced yesterday, and the capsuleers cried out unto God through their tears, for this was the end of subcapital warfare and the fear of magical teleporting Titans sent millions of innocent fleet commanders to the asylum. The jump bridges, cured of disease, allowed people to maneuver their fleets easily across the cluster, and this once-lost newfound freedom scared the capsuleers who wished to return to the comfort of another dark age of jump fatigue.

But lo, I have been granted a vision by the Lord. I see Rexchancellor Vily and The Mittani (pbuh). Both are piloting supercarriers.

"I've got you now, Mittani!" Vily screamed out, T-posing in victory as he sent his fighters out from his Aeon aganst the Lord of Delve.

The Mittani (pbuh) smirked, and teleported behind him because there was no jump fatigue. "Nothing personal--"

Vily teleported behind the Mittani (pbuh), because there was no jump fatigue. "Nothing personal--"

And so did this cycle continue forever, and these two leaders were completely absent for a time. Roaming shitstack Titan fleets from Horde and Imperium and TEST space continuously assaulted the servers, causing multiple crashes. Rorquals were immune from all capital warfare, and there were always orgies in the asteroid belts, hindered not by kinkshaming dreadbombs.

And CCP Guard saw all this, and saw this was good.

Until, a thought crossed his mind. His evil plans were starting to unravel. "NO," he shouted, hopping on his horse with the booster seat on the saddle, riding to Tash-Murkon.

&#x200B;

Truly you are all in error, for the greatest of all miracles shall come from these troubled times. I see a capsuleer swathed in tattered robes using a walking stick, leading his fleeing followers to the edge of Tash-Murkon. CCP Guard is behind them, charging forth with a kopesh drawn, leading an army of CCP interns and the balance team. But it is too late. The new jump bridges have undone their oppression.

"With this staff," says a voice from the stars.

This capsuleer lifts their staff.

"You... shall do... MY WONDERS!"

And Stainguy SMASHES his staff down into the sphincter of spacetime, ripping open a brand new pathway. Parting the stars in the sky, a stargate comes to life in a supernova of divine light. This was true power, THIS was the new age of the lowsec gate to Stain.

&#x200B;

"NOOOOOOOOOOO," CCP Games cried out in unison, but they couldn't undo this, as their new player stargates couldn't be removed due to it being tied to legacy codes that would remove asteroids without these stargates. The oppression of Sansha's Nation was over.

&#x200B;

We are going to be FREE!

BATTLE REPORT: SIEGE OF 29YH-V
War. War never changes. Unless it's patch day.

&#x200B;

War. War has changed.

&#x200B;

[https://zkillboard.com/related/30003171/201810112000/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30003171/201810112000/)

&#x200B;

Fleet Commander Silvana Cadelanne of the Le Grande Nachos Foreign Legion was under seige by TEST Alliance Please Ignore. Our cloaked scouts watched the gates with an exhausted eye. There were thirteen T-rexes commanding an ungodly amount of Velociraptor-piloted fighters, waiting for us to warp in. There were three lizard wizards, using a flock of tyrannical birds and a sword to conjure massive interdiction bubbles, keeping us from escaping.

&#x200B;

We thought we could wait it out.

&#x200B;

We didn't.

&#x200B;

Silvana, frustrated by the fact that TEST dropped massive dildos instead of the small anal beads he wanted, desperately tried to warp our Wolf fleet around, finding a weakness in the bubble fortifications. He spent three years looking for one, with none to be found. We were out of Kirkland Protein Bars, and slowly starving. Some of us pooped for the first time in four years.

&#x200B;

As he was mulling it over, I went mad and came to the conclusion that I am indestructible and I could probably escape by myself. As the FC continued desperately to warp, I warped to a citadel, than warped into one of the gate bubbles. I turned on my ADC and turned on my microwarp drive. The stars of 29YH-V were unknown to me, as my world for three seconds was a mass of teeth and claw. I heard the mighty roar of the theropods and the screeches of the Velociraptors as they gave chase as ordered. Fighters, interdictors, Dreadnaughts, interceptors descended upon me like the plagues of the North.

&#x200B;

It turns out that we could've done this three years ago, because it turns out a Wolf with a microwarpdrive can take you to the gate from thirty kilometers to zero really quick. I jumped and landed in DL-. A Tengu slithered towards me. I pee'd on him with my artillery cock and he ran away.

&#x200B;

The FC called to jump to the gate and see what he could do in terms of burning out of the bubbles. I heard the screams of my comrades, the gnashing of razor sharp teeth, and the European accent of Silvana trying to keep order.

&#x200B;

It was then I saw a vision. It was Remedial, wearing a keychain as his wedding ring, and Kartoon, the Lords of Straight Heaven, whose heterosexual treachery nearly destroyed us so many years ago.

&#x200B;

"Yes, run, leave your Goons behind. Fuck them," said Kartoon, pretending to speak in Arabic. "Do they deserve you?"

&#x200B;

Remedial tried to hold my hand, and almost ate it if I had not pulled it away. "I have an Erebus you can fly if you do." He started to eat a living pig in front of me, unhinging his jaw as he swallowed it like a snake.

&#x200B;

But I heard the voice of The One Who Was Redeemed, who had fuckgooned once and returned, but forever vacationed later. A real goon. I heard his soothe, calming voice call out to me.

&#x200B;

^("LISTEN TO... LISTEN TO ME YOU FUCKING PIECE OF)

# HUMAN FUCKING GARBAGE."

&#x200B;

I couldn't believe it! It was SUAS!

&#x200B;

"SUAS, I loved your--"

&#x200B;

*"I said*

# SHUT UP

\*\*Look. See. When I'\*\**m talking right* ***yo.. GO BACK IN THERE AND KILL A FUCKING VELOCIRAPTOR."***

&#x200B;

He threw a whiskey bottle at me.

&#x200B;

"But my FC told me to go to 1DQ1--"

&#x200B;

He pulled out a revolver.

&#x200B;

# "I WILL FUCKING

I will **FUCKING KILL YOU.. FUCKING SHITHEAD--"**

&#x200B;

I jumped through the stargate, as I heard the screams of Remedial and Kartoon fleeing from whiskey bottles and gunfire.

&#x200B;

There I was invisible. The endless armies of dinosaurs reared their heads toward the gatefire. Having heard the call of my ancestor, I found a Velociraptor. I turned on Little Bee, and uncloaked. Having turned on my ADC, I locked up the Velociraptor named Hilix Sotken, and started pummeling his stilleto sphincter with the greatest weapons system of EVE Online: Artillery.

&#x200B;

Now, the fatal flaw of the TEST dinosaur army was clear. Having tortured Seddow on NER comms for information, he told me that because T-rexes have short arms, it takes a while for them to grasp their mouse and keyboard to lock you up. With this information, I let my guns **ROAR** ***DEATH AND THUNDER*** into Hilix's butthole. He screamed as all velociraptors are wont to do, but was too panicked to fly out.

&#x200B;

I took damage. The velociraptor fighters descended upon me, shooting me in the chest. I was not deterred. You all expect that I would run because I am a Goon. I fight because I am a Goon. I do not feel pain. I only feel what the Mittani (pbuh) tells me to feel.

&#x200B;

AND

^(I)

**FEEL**

# GAY

&#x200B;

I WATCHED AS THE STILLETO ***BURNED AND SPARKED AND ERUPTED INTO A SUPERNOVA OF JET FUEL AND STEEL.***

[https://zkillboard.com/kill/72866255/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/72866255/)

&#x200B;

My last act, my final stand.

&#x200B;

I died.

&#x200B;

Turns out I am immortal because I respawned in Delve.

&#x200B;

Needless to say we won. Spodbless.

Supreme Inquisitor's Written Dispatch to Pandemic Horde
This is an official dispatch to Gobbins, and to the sickening masses that comprise Pandemic Horde.

Climate change is a reality that must be confronted. As sea levels rise and the storms bring ruin from the skies, humanity must find ways of counteracting the poison they have put into their own environment. It is almost comical how hard it is to convince humanity to not commit global suicide as they poison the air with the bliss of a child, almost as if they must be forced to save themselves.

Such as it is with Pandemic Horde, and you, Gobbins the Plaguebearer. The fabric of the north frays with every passing decision you make. The beach-heads once constructed by Guardians of the Galaxy, the Northern Coalition, Brothers of Tangra, and Pandemic Legion has been washed away by your negligence, and the crashing waves of the Imperium that will be at your doorstep.

The Goontide is rising, and the waves will crash down on your alliance. The fires of your industry shall be smoldered, and your fleets and fortifications shall be washed away as the storm of our wrath rains terror and destruction on Geminate. 

We are willing and able to wipe the north clean of the Horde, and bury the very concept of your alliance's existence under the sands of its own incompetence. Your chasing away all of your allies makes the task all the easier.

However, there is a way to save yourself and your alliance.

I, Supreme Inquisitor Naz al-Ghul, **command** you to evict the Circle-of-Two from your sovereignty, and immediately set them as red to your alliance. I **order** you to chase them out with your fleets, and destroy their ships as they flee to the Drone Regions, or wherever they seek refuge. You must lower CO2 levels to keep the tide from rising. You must eliminate CO2 to save yourself from your own destruction. It is ignorance to think you can continue allowing their numbers to rise and still survive. 

Finally, you must send a message open to your alliance addressing the Imperium, and publicly apologize for thinking you can get away with providing CO2 sanctuary. You will apologize to the Mittani (pbuh), and promise you will never let it happen again.

Either way, it won't.

Gobbins is Mad
Sort Dragon left the parking lot of the 1DQ1-A Keepstar and drove home. He was covered in velociraptor bites, bruises and burns, but his Coalition was secure. The Guardians of the Galaxy would live to guard the galaxy another day, thanks to his deal.

It was a dark night, driving through outer space. Deklein was a far drive from Delve. His Chevy had a great align time, so he had dodged every gatecamp and gracefully weaved through every bubble, but it was a lonely drive and he was hungry. The Mittani (pbuh) didn't let him eat at the Keepstar.

Sort Dragon pulled into a diner off the asteroid belt in Cloud Ring and sat down at the table. *Oh boy,* Sort Dragon thought excitedly. *This is a good diner!*

Sort found a box of crayons and flipped over the sheet of advertisement paper and began coloring in the teddy bear picture on the back. This was almost therapeutic, and for once today, he was at peace. 

The dark figure watching him from the corner of the room allowed him that much reprieve.

Eventually, Sort Dragon acknowledged the waitress and ordered an orange juice. She wrote it down and walked off to acquire it, and that's when the dark figure stood up, and his arm exploded into a mass of tentacles and barbed wire, grappling poor Sort Dragon and throwing him into the diner's bar stools.

"TRAITOR!"

Gobbins leaped up onto one of the closest tables, and took off his trenchcoat. He was not a man, but a miserable pile of tentacles, eyes, and a short amount of temper.

"You gave into the Goons!" Gobbins said. Angry ribbits from Gobbins' armpits called out for Sort's blood. "Do you have any idea what you've done?!"

"Guarantee the survival of my alliance?" Sort answered miserably. All he wanted to do was drink his orange juice.

"BEHOLD," Gobbins screamed, slamming a crystal ball onto the barstool chair. "THIS is what you wrought upon us all!" As they stared into it, they saw a Rorqual and a giant Bright Spodumain asteroid making love. To a Goon, the moans and thrusts of these lovers were a beautiful sight, as this was the moment of conception of many a ship and structure for their glorious empire.

*"I'm getting close!* called out the Rorqual, huffing and puffing, smoke blowing from its exhaust pipes as its hydraulics worked ever faster.

*"Please, Rorqual-chan! Excavate my ovaries with your drones! GET ME ASS-PREGNANT WITH YOUR TITAN!!!"* called out the asteroid.

Sort Dragon picked up the crystal ball and smashed it on the ground. "They don't even pay their alliance to *mine..."*

Gobbins blubbered in anger, bubbles forming along his nipples and nose. "I thought you loved me. But you throw away our relationship... for six months of peace!"

"We will rebuild! We'll have a powerful army by then! Trust me!"

"I don't trust you any more," Gobbins sulked, his tentacles no longer wiggling. "You gave Mittens 40 Faction Fortizars so he'd leave you alone for six months. This was the worst deal in the history of trade deals. Perhaps ever. I think it's time for me to see new people. I have a better ally."

"Who?"

"CO2."

A small shiny rectangle produced itself from the swirling sphincter of tentacles. It was brought up to Gobbin's arms as the tentacles passed it over his back and shoulders. He showed a picture of CO2's new leader, Gigatoni XPasta, preserved in a golden frame perhaps worth more ISK than had been produced in Deklein for the past month.

Sort Dragon expected to feel hurt. He felt confused.

"You're like... joking right?"

"Why would I be joking? They even have this new leader--"

"It's the same guy, just under a different name!"

"THERE YOU GO AGAIN, DRINKING THE GOON KOOL-AID!" Gobbins threw up his tentacled hands and slammed them on the table. "We are supposed to be a united north. By taking this deal, what are you now?"

"Existing?"

"What are *we* now?!"

"Existing?"

"Well no longer! Upon the officiating of this deal!" Gobbins' tentacles wrapped around Sort Dragon's ears, ticking the lobes. "We are no longer friends! And I shall send my fleets into your systems! We will destroy your fleets! How do you like that?"

"We don't have fleets anymore," Sort whined. "Goons destroyed them."

"We've already won! Ahahaha!Tomorrow, I shall write up a 20,000 character post explaining why you lost! You supercilious slut! You flamboyant flamingo fuck! I have tickled your catastrophe! AHAAHAHAHAHAHA!"

Gobbins, the Lord of the Horde, spun around on the ground, laughing maniacally as mucus covered the floor. 

"CO2 wasn't even allowed to stay in B0T space, why did Lady Scarlett let you keep them?!" Sort Dragon asked wearily.

"I HAD THIRTY GOODBOY POINTS TO SPEND! AAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!" Gobbins started screaming in laughter, and ran out the door, sucking himself into the vacuum of space.

Sort Dragon went back to drink his orange juice.

SUPREME INQUISITOR'S DISPATCH: PRAISE TO THE IMPERIUM, WARNING TO THE REGION OF MALPAIS


The Deal of a Lifetime
The Mittani (pbuh) sat upon His throne in the former CSM meeting room, whose doors serve as an interdimensional gate to the 1DQ1-A Keepstar. To his left Kendarr stood, eyeing the guests intently. He was the Dread Admiral of Space Violence, but he didn't meet his quota on SV members newly trained into a Dreadnaught so he was forced to be a security guard for six years. At His Majesty's right stood Dabigredboat, Hero of Asakai and the Invisible Wolf of Bomberwaffe. He always was the main bodyguard for the Mittani (pbuh), looking for potential assailants even as he listened to Nickelback songs on his HitClips player.

As usual, the halls of the Keepstar were packed with esteemed guests. The President of the United States was making conversation with the former leader of Stainwagon Elazar Keon concerning a personal favor he was owed, and Jay Amazingness was sadly subject to the flirtations of Catherine Zeta Jones when his intentions was to wine and dine with Zack Efron. Normal day, nothing particularly of note.

The Mittani (pbuh) wasn't interested in speaking to these... commoners. No doubt He had more important concerns. He was personally overseeing the massive war He had declared in EVE Online. A war by many names. I call it the Great Plague War, INN insists on calling it something incredibly boring, and the pubbies were constantly trying to make a World War III pun again. But I digress, The Lord of Delve was winning this war. He was winning hard. He was actually getting bored of winning.

Normally He would respond to High Commander Asher Elias' texts asking for praise after every victory, and The Mittani (pbuh) would usually come to Asher's house and repeatedly beat him with a golf club, leaving only after saying "That battle was alright. Now do it again." Now, The Mittani (pbuh) was so bored with the affair that He was half-heartedly just texting back "That's nice dear, I've venmo'd you a fiver. Go buy yourself a pack of Yu-Gi-Oh cards."

Yes, it was time to wrap up this war. As a matter of fact, this was what the party was for. Everyone who knew anything knew about it (which is why I didn't) and the Mittani (pbuh) stood from His throne to begin His speech. Naturally, everyone from the President to the CCP staff members he had imprisoned stopped what they were doing to listen.

"Ladies and gentlemen and Jeff Goldblum," The Mittani (pbuh) began. "I want to discuss with you today--"

Then something happened. Something unprecedented.

Someone interrupted Him.

Scarlett Johansson dressed in Samurai armor burst through the doors dragging in a man bound in chains who wore only an Ultimo Dragon luchador mask and a kilt. "My lord, I apologize for the interruption." She said.

"You're not forgiven," The Mittani (pbuh) said. "But I'll throw you out of the airlock later. Why do you have Sort Dragon tied up?"

Sort Dragon pulled himself away from Scarlett's grasp. "I am the Duke of Deklein and Baron of Branch, Sort Dragon. I must say, thou art a wicked host Mittani. Royalty should be treated with respect!"

"Which is why I give none," The Mittani (pbuh) replied. "Why have you come to face me?"

"Prithee be merciful! My alliance is tired and weak, like the babe of a starving lamb! Thou art liketh a--"

"Why are you talking like that," The Mittani (pbuh) asked, irritated.

"It's talk like a pirate day."

"That was yesterday, and not how pirates talk." The Mittani (pbuh) smacked Dabigredboat so he would stop listening to Nickelback for a moment. "Beat him up and throw him out of the airlock."

"Yes, my Lord,” Dabigreadboat obeyed. The Hero of Asakai charged at Sort Dragon, who was helpless to resist Boat’s jaws as he bit down on the wretched prince of DARKNESS. and shook him. Sort Dragon struggled and screamed, but Boat threw him onto the table, bit onto his arm, and did an alligator death roll. With a disturbing *CRACK!* Boat had twisted Sort’s arm off the socket, and began to devour it.

Scarlett asked Mittani (pbuh), “Can I be spared of death?”

“Can I be spared of that awful romantic subplot between you and Bruce Banner in the Avengers movie?” He challenged. 

*”Wait!”* Sort demanded. The Mittani (pbuh) flew off His throne and like a graceful ballerina, roundhouse kicked Sort Dragon repeatedly until Sort Dragon cried.

“I am The Mittani,” The Lord of Delve said, kicking Sort in the balls. The Mittani (pbuh) was shirtless, but he was wearing leather pants and combat boots with steel toes. “I will not be commanded.”

“I wish to start over in good faith, may I?”

“...Alright.”

“o7,” Sort Dragon greeted unironically. The Mittani (pbuh) kicked Sort in the teeth. “I want to surrender! You have destroyed my alliance’s will to fight, my allies are abandoning me and refusing to fight, and Elise Randolph is calling me names!”

“Well that’s fine, but I was already--”

“Please, Mittani! I betrayed the GigX! I even reported him and got him banned again!”

“We fed him to Sapporo, you had nothing to--”

“I’ll do anything! Please, let us live!”

The Mittani (pbuh) realized what this meant. Sort Dragon was many things, but a man of dignity and self-respect he was not. He *would* do anything.

“Yeah that’s nice but we’re already--” Boat was interrupted by the Mittani (pbuh) slamming his head into an ice sculpture of a naked Karttoon (it was tradition to blowtorch it after every party to represent that he went to Hell).

“Boat, I talk, you eat people,” The Lord of Delve turned His attention back to Sort. “Anything?”

“Anything.”

The Mittani (pbuh) gave it some thought. Then He remembered a couple hundred years ago. Thomas Jefferson prayed to God for guidance about whether or not to make the Louisina Purchase, and The Mittani (pbuh) answered His prayer and told Thomas Jefferson to kill himself while wearing a wizard’s hat, and then said yes he should splurge. Thomas Jefferson made a ridiculously lowball price and the French were desperate enough to say yes to it.

“I’ll accept your surrender, for uh…” The Mittani (pbuh) began to think of the most ridiculous shit He could demand. It was hard for Him to come up with something stupid, because the Mittani (pbuh) was a perfect genius who was unmatched even by other gods. Eventually He came up with something ridiculous.

“Forty faction fortizars, and you only get six months reprieve. This only applies to Guardians of the Galaxy so everyone knows you were only looking out for your own hide…”

“That is objectively true.”

The Mittani (pbuh) breathed fire on Sort Dragon and kicked him until he stopped screaming and the fire went out. “Do not interrupt me. You’re also not allowed to attack our structures. Any of them.”

”That sounds unfair.”

“Furthermore this only applies to us attacking you, not any of our allies. So TEST can decide to attack you if they want.”

“This deal is getting worse all the time.”

The Mittani’s (pbuh) eyes narrowed. Even the eye on the Imperium’s symbol that was behind His throne squinted.

“Furthermore I command you to wear this dress and bonnet.” The Mittani (pbuh) took Jay Amazingness’ handbag and pulled the clothing out.

“What?! But I--”

“And here is a unicycle! You will ride it wherever you go!” The Mittani (pbuh) shoved the unicycle up Sort’s ass, and Sort let out an uncomfortable moan.

“THIS IS…. fine, I’ll do it. Where do you want the Faction Fortizars?”

“Just dump them out back, I’ll probably just throw them in Tribute or something.” The Mittani (pbuh) shrugged. He produced a contract out of thin air outlining the conditions of the arrangement. Sort Dragon signed without hesitation.

The Mittani (pbuh) punched Sort Dragon in the face. “Now get out of my sight.”

Sort Dragon then left the Keepstar, happy about his arrangement. However, upon delivering the Citadels, Sort Dragon was eaten by velociraptors and his bones were taken by Serbian carpenters to make a toilet seat.

A proposal on how to fix the wardec system
This has been a problem that has plagued EVE Online for the past decade. In high security space, belonging to a corporation or an alliance or any formal organization that encourages communal play is quite ill-advised. Upon discovery,  a group of EVE Online PVPers manipulate a poorly thought out and often abused war-declaration system. They pay a small fee, and suddenly one will be able to attack any member of that corporation.

&#x200B;

The intended purpose was to bring some risk into high security space. Mercenaries would be hired to attack a major corporation and said corporation would be required to defend their assets. This system could also be used aggressively by pirates to perhaps loot an unsuspecting freighter.

&#x200B;

However, as it stands now the system functions as follows: Several PVP alliances will wardec the same alliance and now suddenly all of high-security space is a danger. This defeats the purpose of high-security space, but it doesn't actively encourage highsec players to undock and defend themselves. It encourages them to leave their corp and set up a new one, or just wait for the wardec to expire. Perhaps it forces them to not join a corporation at all.

&#x200B;

I have a solution to all this.

&#x200B;

Restrict an alliance/corporation to only be able to declare war against one alliance/corporation. There can only be one war declared against this corporation at a time in any official capacity.

&#x200B;

Then what you do is you continue to destroy wormhole space. Yeah that's right. You didn't see that coming motherfucker. This is a wormhole hate post. CCP Games thank you. Thank you for changing those HICtors. They don't deserve to penetrate those holes with such frivolity and glamour. They're wormholers. They don't even show up in local so they're clearly anti-social. Ramming into holes to make them a tighter fit for others is a fucking travesty. Nerf the Porpoise too. Delete wormhole space. But don't actually delete wormhole space. Lock them into wormhole space and keep them entirely separate from K-Space. If you die in wormhole space then you wake up in a random wormhole and have to scan your way back, but in wormholes you should only have one (1) probe. If they want to open a K-space connection, charge them twenty dollars. You're Pearl Abyss now, you can do that so long as you also give them cat ears and a maid costume. 

&#x200B;

Fuck wormholers man. Let's destroy them. Let's oppress them. Nullsec supremacy guys. Let's put a plug in their hole and watch them beg us to take it out. Fuck their holes! 

The Money Badger Coalition Was a Paper Tiger
Well that was a bit embarrassing wasn't it?

&#x200B;

I'm honestly a touch disappointed. We killed three Keepstars, all before I ate breakfast. I had scrambled eggs with tabasco sauce on them, some sausage and a glass of orange juice. Now we're going for Keepstar #4.

I just have a couple questions. For the two years that we've been gone and you've been left to live in the North, flexing your muscles at smaller enemies and chasing away enemies you knew you could destroy, I only have these to ask.

&#x200B;

Did you feel in charge?

Did you honestly feel like you had power in New Eden?

&#x200B;

I hope you learned your lesson. We are a harsh teacher.

A Mystery Solved
The staff of CCP Games gathered outside of their headquarters. The sky resembled the snowy screen of a television tuned to a dead channel, and the morning wind brought an unpleasant chill to both skin and bone. A couple years ago I was a weaker man, and would have never made it to Iceland. However, after proving myself worthy of serving the Imperium by mining 69,420,000,000,009,001m3 of Bright Spodumain I was given a Men's Triglavian Survival Suit (Encounter) which was warm enough to keep me comfortable in that awful country.

&#x200B;

I was flanked by fourteen German Shepherd furries who marched behind me. The grim look on the faces of the CCP Employees made it clear we were here on business.

&#x200B;

"Supreme Inquisitor," CCP Guard greeted nervously. "We weren't expecting you. As a matter of fact, I was informed you don't even have a passport."

&#x200B;

"I don't need a passport," I assured him.

&#x200B;

"I'm almost positive that's wrong, but by law I'm not tall enough to argue with you."

&#x200B;

We were getting off track. I gestured to two Black Hand agents, whose cartoon furry eyes shined in the sky's grey incandescence. "Yiff yiff," I commanded. "Yiff yiff yiffyiff yiff. Yiff."

&#x200B;

"Yiff?" The agent questioned.

&#x200B;

*"Yiff,"* I confirmed.

&#x200B;

The pair of Black Hand agents left, and swiftly returned dragging a battered and beaten man in a tracksuit with a black sack over his head. The employees of CCP Games murmered to themselves, confused by the situation. The captive struggled to break free, but as soon as he broke the grip of the Black Hand, all the agents tackled him to the ground, and licked him until the contact-poison seeped into his skin and made it hurt to move.

&#x200B;

"What is the meaning of this," Hillmar asked. "Are you trying to make it harder for me to get Pearl Abyss to turn everyone in EVE Online into girls?"

&#x200B;

"No," I answered, my voice automatically deepened and digitized by a live-action Audacity-powered voice changer. "Rejoice. The Christendom of the Splendrous Mittani (pbuh) has discovered a great crime against all of EVE Online." With a sweeping motion, my hand removed the black sack from the head of the captive. He was a white man in a tracksuit, and he smelled of bootleg tobacco and anger management issues.

&#x200B;

"Serbia?" asked CCP Karkur.

&#x200B;

"N-no. Well, yes. This is GigX, the Butcher of Blue Supercarriers and the Leader of the Circle-of-Two alliance."

&#x200B;

GigX snarled at me, but I slapped him with a nun-chuck made of yaprak, and he went back to grumbling quietly.

&#x200B;

"What does this have to do with anything?" CCP Guard asked. He poked me in the knee accusingly. "We're trying to run a business into the ground here, and you're distracting us by kidnapping GigX! He's banned! Nothing to do with us anymore!"

&#x200B;

"The crimes he has commited are ban evasion. He has been running CO2 and leading fleets despite being permanently banned from EVE Online."

&#x200B;

Everyone in CCP Games turned whiter than normal in horror. The thought of evading a ban had never once crossed their mind. Even the howling wind couldn't drown out the sound of arguing game developers. They were quite beside themselves. Eventually they turned to me, all with incredulous grimaces.

&#x200B;

"Do you mean to tell me," CCP Lelouch began, out of the crowd. "That even after he was banned, GigX made... another account... and started playing EVE Online against our wishes?"

&#x200B;

"Yes," I confirmed.

&#x200B;

I watched as CCP Lelouch grappled with the idea, the implications washing over him, drowning his preconceptions. "No, that can't be right. I don't believe a human being is capable of such evil."

&#x200B;

Thankfully, CCP Guard seemed to be convinced of the possibility because when he lifted the back of GigX's tracksuit, he saw his trampstamp which read "Ban Evader" across the top of his butt.

&#x200B;

"How was he able to get away with this?" CCP Guard asked grimly.

&#x200B;

"GigX's deception was masterful. No one but the sharpest minds could have seen through his deception. Only the Mittani (pbuh) knew the truth. But over time, a lie begins to fall apart. Crucial clues were left behind, making an impossible case easier to follow.

&#x200B;

"His mistakes were few, and it would take a trained eye to catch them. GigX's first mistake we discovered was that when he created his new pilot, he named it TheGigX."

&#x200B;

"So?" CCP Ghost barked incredulously. "GigX is a common name in Serbia. My second cousin's name is GigX."

&#x200B;

"Indeed," I said, poking my Triglavian mask with my Sherlock Holmes style pipe, unable to smoke it. "It was the word The that put me on the trail. There are many GigX's in Serbia because GigX's is perhaps the only notable person to exist in Serbia. When he named himself TheGigX, it led me to suspect that it was *The* GigX who was so publicly banned."

&#x200B;

GigX spat at me. "Cyka blyat."

&#x200B;

"I know you wish to be Russian like all Eastern Europeans secretly wish," I lectured him. "But you don't need to steal their swear words."

&#x200B;

"Once I dug further, his facade fell apart. I was told by Circle-of-Two diplomats that TheGigX was just GigX's wife. But I broke into his home and found there were no women in thirty miles of his home. Not even his mother lived nearby."

&#x200B;

"What is woman?" GigX asked.

&#x200B;

"By Imperium law I am gay and I cannot give an unbiased answer to that question," I answered.

&#x200B;

"Oh, GigX," CCP Guard began to cry. "I can't believe you've done this."

&#x200B;

"Never fear," I consoled CCP Guard, getting on my knees to pat him on the head. "Imperial Legacy shall deal with him in our own way."

&#x200B;

I set a glass of water down on the ground. The water began to ripple as it picked up tremors on the ground. The Earth shook more violently now, and out of the mists stepped a menacing Tyrannosaurus Rex dressed in a suit and tie. It reared up, and let out a deafening roar that caused all of Iceland to shudder in fear.

&#x200B;

"Sapporo!" GigX pleaded. "We were comrade! Free me, and let us kill Goon! You can't be really Imperium ally! Are you? Speak to me!"

&#x200B;

The shadow of doubt fell over GigX's face as Sapporo stared him dead in the eye. It felt like an eternity, as one's final moments tend to feel, until finally out of the maw of sharp teeth Sapporo snarled the words that caused all the North to tremble in hatred and fear.

&#x200B;

*"Casino War!"*

&#x200B;

*"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"* GigX screamed, as Sapporo leaned down and crushed GigX in his jaws, shaking him and swallowing him whole. This was the story of how The Supreme Inquisitor and the Black Hand uncovered the dastardly deception of GigX, and brought justice to EVE Online.

SUPREME INQUISITOR'S DISPATCH TO THE CIRCLE-OF-TWO AND THEGIGX


EVE Online Bought By South Korea
There are many questions I want to ask our New Korean Overlords.

&#x200B;

Will you be interfering a lot with how EVE Online functions, or will you allow CCP Games to be the Seoul purveyor of content patches and expansions?

&#x200B;

What is your view of the representation of women in EVE Online? Will you still encourage a male-dominated game, or will your acquisition of CCP be the beginning of a Girl's Generation of gaming?

&#x200B;

Are you going to keep the EVE Online soundtrack the same, or is that going to go out with a BIGBANG?

&#x200B;

Do you have any Vietnamese employees? Can they personally guarantee that the cash shop will be fair, and not Pay-to-Nguyen?

&#x200B;

THE HEADLINES AT 1900 ON WEDNESDAY THE 15th OF AUGUST 

NER News at 7 o’clock. This is Naz al-Ghul. Good evening.  

Imperial Legacy forces won a hard-fought victory in T2-V8F, reinforcing a Winter Coalition fortizar. 
Imperial Legacy soundly defeated the Northern Bloc over a fortizar in X36Y-G, putting it into final reinforcement. 

--- 

IMPERIAL LEGACY ON THE ATTACK IN T2-V8F 
Imperial Legacy achieved an objective victory at T2-V8F in Tenerifis as they clashed against Fraternity and their allies over the armor timer of a Fortizar early this morning. TEST Alliance Please Ignore brought their Nightmare fleets to bear against Black Legion and Northern Coalition Muninns. 

NC. and their allies raced to defend their allied Citadel and prior to the capital drop, bore as fierce a fury out of their Munnins as TEST's Nightmares. However, NC. and their allies showed up late, which provided Imperial Legacy enough time to reinforce the Fortizar.

Viewing the battle purely from the perspective of the ISK war, the battle falls out of Imperial Legacy's favor in this engagement, but the Fortizar's fate is made uncertain after Imperial Legacy achieved its objective of reinforcing the armour of the structure. 

---  

IMPERIAL LEGACY VICTORY IN X36Y-G 
Imperial Legacy won both the objective and ISK-war over the Northern Bloc in a battle yesterday evening in X36Y-G. An Imperium Megathron fleet, aided by a bomber wing, clashed with Northern Munnins over the armour timer of a Fraternity fortizar in the system. 

From looking at the battle-report, it appears that the Imperial Legacy battleships used their high per-shot damage to alpha through the opposing cruisers. They then went on to reinforce the fortizar. It’s final timer is on the 22nd of August, and will likely lead to another brawl.
NER will keep you in the loop as the situation progresses. 

--- 

NOW, FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENTS 

--- 

FADE 

In a brief skirmish this afternoon, Circle-Of-Two successfully defended the iHub and TCU in 0-ARFO, Fade, from Imperial Legacy. The clash saw Imperium and Federation Uprising Caracals fighting CO2 interceptors with limited battleship and cruiser support. Circle-Of-Two lost the ISK war, but won the objective. 

--- 

For now, that’s how it is in New Eden. May the dazzling smile of The Mittani (pbuh) light your way to a good day. Goodnight. 

Note to the New Eden Report: Hyperlinks are paid DLC. Please send 69 isk to Naz al-Ghul and I shall edit them in later.

---

This is a bit of mid-week fun. NER has not been seized by the Imperium. There is no reason to be upset. 


A Chance for Mercy
The Northern Epidemic's Keepstar has been destroyed, and the leading alliances of said Coalition suffered a massive humiliating defeat, perhaps the most embarrassing and most lopsided massacre in all of EVE Online history. You don't even have your ISK war to fall back on.

All you complain about is lag.

Please, go back to Counter-Strike.

But anyways, smugging is all well and good, but as you know I am a man of business, and it's time to get down to business.

The Supreme Inquisitor's attention is set on the Circle-of-Two.

You just watched the two most famous elite PVP alliances get their teeth kicked in by the Imperial Legacy, and then you watched us burn their house down. The Mittani (pbuh) was mercilessly vague and left you wondering, but I'll be kind and frank with you.

We're going to burn down your Keepstar. We're going to then burn down your fleet. Then, we're going to hunt your moveop until your alliance is nothing but cinders and GigX is covered in the ashes of your ships. This includes you, yes you, person with roles, or person who is aspiring to get roles in CO2. The more important you are, the hotter the fire.

However, I'm the Supreme Inquisitor. Perhaps I can put in a good word for a few of you, perhaps provide safe passage. Hell, I might even vouch some of you individuals into some of the more elite alliances. All you need to do is one thing:

Surrender your Keepstar to me.

Remember a few months ago, when this same exact thing happened? We struck this same deal with the Judge, and now he's in the CSM. He's an incredibly important and powerful person in EVE Online, and what he did was give us a Keepstar. This could be you. You could be one of those names they talk about for years at EVE Vegas, instantly recognizable by players, plus you'd be backed by the largest alliance in the game.

All you need to do is turn over the Keepstar.

THE SUPREME INQUISITOR'S FINAL DISPATCH TO THE NORTHERN EPIDEMIC


Killah Bee's Secret Strategy
I'm pleased to announce to you all that I was able to extract some information regarding NCDot's strategy, known as Operation: To Boldly Flee. Killah Bee is personally overseeing this operation.

Many anime catgirls died bringing me this information.

It was a sacrifice I was willing to make.  


The Northern Coalition is planning to undock from their Keepstar at 1600 EVE Time, around the same time as the Imperial Legacy plans to visit their staging system. An NCDot member asked whether they'll be allowed to undock their faction titans for this operation. Killah Bee didn't hear him at first according to catgirl spy Nyan Nyan, but he was more preoccupied with trying to get his trench coat to flap dramatically in the wind so he could look cool (he calls that effect the Killah Breeze). 

Upon registering the question, Killah Bee told them that the alliance has been banned from using faction titans. Not only that, the Northern Coalition would not even allow its members to use faction ammo. When someone mentioned they wanted to roam on an alt flying a Vexor Navy Issue, Killah Bee immediately slurped his liver out of his asshole with his long Gungan tongue and left him to die.

When Killah Bee was done rolling his tongue back into his mouth like a Fruit by the Foot, he pulled out his Etch-a-Sketch which showed as precise a drawing of the Keepstar as the device would allow. Two other people held Etch-a-Sketches of "T1 Titans" and flew them gently around Killah Bee, orbiting him at 500m. These two NCDotters made wooshing and UFO noises to add effect.

And this, is what Killah Bee told his alliance verbatim.

"We're going to lose the Keepstar. You'll never have a war where you just win. But I've been watching this great military mind named Paul Joseph Watson. He has taught me that to defeat your enemy, to.... own them as he says... sometimes requires you to do strange things. He eats Asian food while drinking milk, refrains from eye contact, and does the OK sign. All at once. Every meal. He is even rumored to have worn a diaper. But he is an undefeated warrior. So to own the Goons, we're going to destroy the Keepstar first."

Nyan Nyan, despite being a spy, was honestly too curious for her own good and raised her hand during the SOTA.

"...Nani? You mean... the Keepstar in 6RC?"

"No," Killah Bee said exhasperated. His genius was never recognized. All those years in r/atheism where he spoke at great lengths about how much God doesn't exist to people who completely agreed with him were wasted on these people. "We're going to destroy *this* Keepstar in X47L-Q."

"The one you're--we're... staging from?"

"Yes."

"But *why?"*

"To own the Goons! If you don't remember, we did this a few weeks ago. Our allied Citadels were vulnerable. The Goons were about to kill them. We had to act. So we killed their faction Citadels."

"So the plan is that in order to foil the Goons..."

"We complete their stratop *first!"*

Nyan Nyan looked a little confused. "...Are you sure you don't want to join Goons?"

"Why would I want to do that? They're trying to destroy our allied Citadels!"

"You're *actually* destroying your allied Citadels!"

"I *know, and they'd never expect it!"*

Nyan Nyan was not able to compose herself. She dropped corp and fled back to 6RCQ, and delivered this report to my desk. I gave her a pat on the head, and allowed her to play Heroes of Might and Magic III for the rest of the evening as a reward for her intel. Funny that she stopped playing Necropolis after that spy-op.

\---

(this is one hundred percent what I believe is going to happen because we're not at war with an alliance we're at war with a cabal of cartoon characters).

THE SUPREME INQUISITOR'S DISPATCH TO THE NORTHERN EPIDEMIC


An Open Letter to Cormack the Great and Other Faction Titan Pilots of NCDot
Attention, Faction Titan pilots of the Northern Coalition. The Supreme Inquisitor of the Imperial Ministry of Truth speaks!

[From my elite spy network of anime catgirls ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBsfMCC7YHE)I have learned that the Faction Titan Pilot is a second class citizen of your alliance. You aren't allowed to fly on the same Keepstar defense fleets as the other Titan pilots, you are made to sit in the back of the Erebus on the way to work and back home, and even worse: even after they tell you to dock back up into your Keepstar, CCP keeps you from complying with your orders for six hours, sparking ethnic tension between you and the non-faction Titans in your fleet.

Now, I can't claim to be a spokesperson. I'm a subcap PVP pilot, and speak from a position of privilege. I've never fit an officer mod in my life, and my ideal fleet is not floating in space in a Naglfar waiting for Asher to disappoint me. I can't begin to understand your suffering. I've never once been hated by women (though I fully comply with the Imperium's policy of state-enforced homosexuality), nor do I have to load stront to be relevant in my T1 Thrasher. However, I do hear the cry of your people. You work endlessly day after day to kill easy PVP targets with your Doomsday, unsatisfied but temporarily relieved that Lady Scarlett's Attack Octopus haven't fondled your anus with a copy of the Wallstreet Journal. You're tired, poor, yearning to be free. Yearning to be able to undock your Vanquisher and know that your insanely blingy faction Titan is fully covered under SRP.

Have you ever wanted to escape racism? Have you ever wanted to fly free in outer space that's been emancipated from your overlords in order to create a fully-automated gay space communist paradise? Have you ever looked at a picture of the Mittani (pbuh) and said "[Yes, this is the man I want to carry me home bridal-style as he wears Samurai armor" ?](https://i.imgur.com/zhVxc42.png)

Then I want to tell you that you're not infected by the Northern Epidemic after all. You have the opportunity to escape, and enjoy  life in the Imperial Legacy under our refugee program. We will house you, feed you, and you will finally be able to nuzzle into the chest of the Mittani (pbuh). I remember when I first did that. I nuzzled Him, He set me down on top of my Rorqual, and then He rode His majestic unicorn with the rainbow mane into the East to fight Vily in a lightsaber duel for a couple weeks while I guess we flew a bunch of Claws and our Russian allies in Stain didn't do anything.

Thankfully we're not doing that this time and now that TEST is our friend I can publicly use my T-Rex salt and pepper shakers without worrying about the Black Hand's Fursecution Squad.

Karmafleet's recruiting.

It is My Birthday
It is my Birthday today, and I have this thing where I like to be nice to people rather than expect presents on my birthday. So, lemme put aside the persona a bit and just say the following:

What I have received as a present for the last two years is a fantastic community of players. I've always wanted to be part of an MMO's community, but either the MMO felt too theme parkey or the game wasn't really an MMO and the community was no more than the comments section on patch notes.But here I feel like I can connect to a lot of people all at once, and I am grateful to all of you for being a part of this massive space simulation game. You bring a lot of joy into my life, no matter your side in the Great Plague War or the battles to come.

When I read Empires of EVE, I felt like I should join the Goonswarm Federation, and that alliance and the Imperium as a whole has the best group of players I've had the privilege of playing a game with. I've been mentioned by the Mittani (pbuh) in a Fireside (still on cloud nine from that) and while I've never met him, I thank him for maintaining the Imperium and the Goonswarm as well as tolerating every single homoerotic fanfiction I have written (and will continue to write) about him. This will either get me personally vouched into GEWN by the Mittani (pbuh) or kicked from the alliance, I'm looking forward to the end result.

I want to also thank TEST for being in existence. I almost joined your alliance but as a newbie I only knew about Dreddit which at the time required thirty days activity on Reddit, but I hated Reddit at the time and couldn't keep up the game for that long. But you were the initial spark that got me thinking about nullsec before I read about the Spinning Bishounen The Mittani (pbuh) in Empires of EVE and how Goons kicked BoB's ass. So thank you Rexchancellor Vily and all y'all TEST pilots.

PL/NCDot/Northern Epidemic/etc: I entertained the idea of elite PVP but I don't have the energy to give a crap about my killboard beyond considering it an album of good times with my friends. But I will not discount your skill in fighting on the battlefield. You are passionate players, and I admire the amount of time you've put into the game. Especially NCDot with their legendary corp, EVOL. I wish I was part of EVE in an earlier time where I could have been a Goon battling SirMolle on the forums in rhetorical duels or just exchanged words with him at all, but I'm really happy that EVOL still stands today. You, members of Evolution, are collectively an obelisk of defiance to the sands of time. What destroys everyone else, you have weathered. You should definitely be proud of that, if you aren't already.

Everyone else, from the guys in Stranger Danger who used to be SIRE. in lowsec to Roland D'Audeles in Minmatar Faction Warfare, and all of you who participate here in EVE Online, I'm really glad to be a part of all this.

Alright, now let's put on that persona again.

AW YEAH WE FUCKING REFFED THAT KEEPSTAR. EVERY SINGLE TITAN YOU KILLED WAS AUTOMATICALLY REPLACED. EVERY LAST ONE IMMEDIATELY. GOONWAFFE PILOTS GET DOUBLE TITAN SRP, SO FOR EVERY TITAN YOU KILLED TWO MORE TAKE IT'S PLACE. WE ARE THE HYDRA OF EVE ONLINE EXCEPT WE'RE NOT THE HYDRA IN EVE ONLINE CUZ THEY'RE PUBBIES. WE ARE EVERYWHERE, WE ARE EVERYONE. YOUR NEIGHBOR? BLACK HAND AGENT. YOUR SISTER? DAWN RHEA. THE PRIEST IN YOUR CHURCH? ME. HEY, WE'RE GAY, AND YOU'RE IN OUR WAY!

ATTENTION! A QUARANTINE IS NOW IN EFFECT!

THE IMPERIAL LEGACY'S INTERGALACTIC MINISTRY OF HEALTH HAS DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE UPPER REGIONS OF NULLSEC, AUTHORIZED BY REXCHANCELLOR VILY OF THE LEGACY COALITION AND KING OF THE TYRANT WIZARDS OF TEST ALLIANCE PLEASE IGNORE, AND THE MITTANI (PBUH), SUPREME LEADER OF THE IMPERIUM AND GOD-EMPEROR OF THE GOONSWARM FEDERATION.

THIS BIPARTISAN DECISION HAS TITLED THIS EFFORT AS: "THE GREAT PLAGUE WAR," AS THE IMPERIAL LEGACY PLANS TO CURE NULL-SEC OF PANDEMIC LEGION/HORDE, NCDOT, AND ITS CARRION VASSAL STATES KNOWN COLLECTIVELY AS THE NORTHERN EPIDEMIC.

FOR THOSE UNSURE OF THEIR INFECTION, ASK YOURSELF THE FOLLOWING:

* DO YOU CHECK ZKILLBOARD RELIGIOUSLY TO ENSURE THAT YOUR DEADLY RATING IS AT LEAST 69%?

\[editors note: in NCDot, Lady Scarlett sends Attack Octopi to your home to sodomize you with a copy of the Wall Street Journal if you do not comply with this regulation.\]

* ARE YOU ASHAMED OF DISCUSSING PVE ACTIVITY IN EVE ONLINE BECAUSE YOU MIGHT BE KICKED OUT OVER BEING A CAREBEAR WHEN YOU JUST WANT TO BUY YOUR SHIPS MORE EFFICIENTLY?
* **HAVE YOU FELT ANY ATTRACTION TO THE OPPOSITE SEX?**
* HAVE YOU COME TO BELIEVE THAT BLACK LEGION HAS ANY RELEVANCE TO THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE OF EVE ONLINE'S NULLSEC COMMUNITY?
* HAVE YOU SUDDENLY STOPPED WATCHING KOREAN ASMR VIDEOS BECAUSE YOU PREFER ENGLISH-SPEAKING ASMR?
* HAVE YOU EVER AT ONE POINT THOUGHT YOU LOOKED COOL IN A TRENCHCOAT OR DISCUSSED ONLINE ABOUT HOW MUCH ATHEISM MEANS TO YOU?

THESE ARE SYMPTOMS OF NORTHERN EPIDEMIC. THE NORTHERN EPIDEMIC IS A TERRIBLE VIRUS. IT WILL MAKE YOU STRAIGHT. IT WILL MAKE YOU NOT WANT TO SUCK DICKS. IT WILL MAKE YOU HALLUCINATE ELO KNIGHT'S IMPORTANCE. IT WILL MAKE YOU THINK YOU CAN WIN AGAINST THE IMPERIAL LEGACY. YOU CANNOT WIN AGAINST THE IMPERIAL LEGACY.

THIS QUARANTINE BEGINS ON THE KEEPSTAR IN X47L-Q. THE IMPERIAL MINISTRY OF TRUTH HAS FOUND A CURE FOR THIS HETEROSEXUAL HEALTH CRISIS BY USING THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH GAINED FROM THE MINISTRY OF LOVE'S ACTIVITIES ON HIGH-SEC MINERS.

THE CURE FOR THE NORTHERN EPIDEMIC IS FIRE.

FIRE FROM ANTIMATTER, VOID, ANY AMMUNITION VARIANT IN EVE ONLINE WILL DO. DO NOT FEEL AS THOUGH YOU ARE "MURDERING" THE VICTIMS OF A DISEASE! YOU ARE CURING THEM. MURDER IS A PROGRESSIVE BUZZWORD USED BY PROMINENT SPOKESPEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PAID OFF BY BALKAN MOBSTERS. WE NEED TO RETAKE THE WORD MURDER FROM THEM.

I REPEAT: MURDER IS GOOD. KILL THEM WITH FIRE. CURE THEM WITH DEATH.

THE IMPERIAL LEGACY WILL BURN THE NORTH DOWN.

\[you hear a shattering. The spacebar of the keyboard broke. the author uses copy and paste to copy spaces.\]

THE FIRE HAS STARTED.

THE FIRE RISES.

CURE THE NORTHERN EPIDEMIC.

KILL THEM WITH FIRE.

Concerning Mod Bias on r/eve
My name is Naz al-Ghul. You might know me as the Supreme Inquisitor of the Imperial Ministry of Truth, propaganda arm of the Goonswarm Federation and the Imperium Coalition. You might know me as a shitposter, perhaps a better shitposter than most. But I'm going to put aside the persona, and talk to you about a controversial subject that affects our community at all levels.

I want to talk to you about the political bias affecting the subreddit of r/eve, namely those affecting the Imperial Legacy and the Northern Epidemic.

In order to do this, I will let you know that I am an investigative journalist for the New York Times who used to do freelance work for CNN. I did work with Christiane Amanpour for her miniseries documentary on radicalized religions, so when I talk to all of you I just want you to know, everything I say carries weight. I've investigated this problem since the first time Pandemic Legion fought TEST Alliance Please Ignore on the outset of this war.

My work has brought to my attention that u/Jibrish, the main administrator of r/eve has exercised extreme bias against the following major players of this war:

* The Imperial Legacy
* The Northern Epidemic
* Other third party combatants

Absolutely disgraceful.

This despicable level of bias as you can see affects a wide variety of posts and limits the content you see. Freedom of speech, as you know, means nothing to the ruthless pro-feminist lobby of the r/eve that will stop at nothing to make sure that you virile young men looking for boyfriend-free girls will no longer be able to post recycled Facebook memes [no matter how powerful and professional you handle the situation and explain why your third-rate recycled garbage should be defecated onto the subreddit.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/458490583099375636/467784303594569738/unknown.png)

This focus on "putting effort into your contributions to the subreddit," and "not posting content that makes people want to pull out a twelve-guage if he ever sees a guy in a t-rex balloon costume in real life or reposting the same stale memes over and over again" is stifling to some levels of the intellectual strata who would rather peel their toenails off than do something original. 

u/Jibrish I got your number. I've got friends in high places. You better watch your back before you stop martyred heroes like u/olmeca_gold from recycling a meme that was deemed "stale" and "a complete waste of time" by a cabal of Antifa sorcerers whose sole desire is to overthrow Hillmar and replace him with Rahne, a famous EVE Online streamer who wants to take all of your testicles and bully you into hard labor in the mines of Iceland. You won't be able to fight back because your lowered testosterone levels won't allow you to, and by the time you see the light of day the ruler of the world will be a woman who considers Black Legion and Elo Knight to be relevant participants in intergalactic affairs and not just nostalgic callbacks to an era where they were actually important to what people do.  


I don't want that future. Do you?

NCDot, can you please give me some time?
This isn't a shitpost, this is like the Christmas Truce from WWI.

I'm literally writing three shitposts a day because of you and PL. I've never been given such a large quantity of material in the course of two or three days.

The War of the Plague is the most confounding event I've had to experience in EVE Online.

For those of you who live under a rock, the Battle of UALX-3 was an objective-based victory for the forces of PL and the Northern Epidemic... and that's practically all. As you know PL, the desire for killmails has costed you your strength. Victory has defeated you.

In other words, they 93PI'd their supers and Titans into UALX-3 where they remain. Then Doomchinchilla attempted a Kusion-tier ruse cruise attempt to fool everyone into thinking the supers and Titans were moved by the developers which would leave them an opportunity to escape when the Hellcamp dissolved. CCP responded before I did. That's fine. I was hoping for a quiet rest of the day.

[THEN THE NORTHERN COALITION, NOT TO BE OUTDONE, KILLS A CO2 FORTIZAR AND A MOA FACTION CITADEL.](https://imperium.news/ncdot-destroys-friendly-faction-fortizars/)

Which leads *me* to ask: but *why?*

Someone told me that NCDot wanted to deny us killmails but there's two problems with this:

1) Goons don't care about killmails. If we cared about killmails we'd be in an alliance of talented PVPers like Initiative. This isn't even a secret, this is common knowledge.

2) Structure bashing is the single most boring part of the war, and you're literally doing it for us. I mean thank you very much, but still... why?

So I can only guess this is a kind of "ritual suicide to own the libs" strategy? I'm sincerely flabbergasted.

But I digress. NCDot, can you please stop giving me material to write shitposts? I need a break. I just want to go on a Baltec fleet, play Dungeons and Dragons, and talk to Koahi in Elysium. You can go a week without doing something incredibly stupid and confounding, right? I mean you've probably managed to not log in for that long. This can't be that hard.

It is a Religious Holiday
This is an important announcement.

Today is the birthday of the Mittani (pbuh), a religious holiday for all members of the Goonswarm Federation. This is a reminder that it is your right as a religious person to call off work to celebrate this momentous occasion which I call  the Yuleswarm.

Remember to light fireworks off of your Keepstars. This goes for allies as well if they wish to participate, but it is mandatory for all able-bodied Goons to launch Fireworks off of the 6RC or 1DQ Keepstar or you will be thrown into the UALX Supermax prison where you must try to drink Dunk Dinkle under the table to earn your release.

A new tradition is to be enacted as well this year. The Triumph of the Rexswarm, a reenactment of a famous battle between us and the bad guys. This is to celebrate the newfound friendship between two alliances within their respective Coalitions. You must have two fully insured capitals or supercapitals. You must have them fight to the death. One of them has to be bubbled, and the other must be repped by a Minokawa. In the meantime, you must collectively z0r chain or BZZZBZZZ in local until the unsupported capital is destroyed.

Please have a safe holiday, unless you're in Sundering. If you're in Sundering, you better shape up.


Thank you.


Update on the Terms set to the Northern Epidemic
Tick, tock.

Tick, tock.

The pendulum swings two and fro like the sword of Damocles.

Tick, tock.

Tick, tock.

Time's up.

Vily has confirmed through undisclosed Imperium Legacy channels that Pandemic Legion and their cabal of malfactors known as the Northern Epidemic have plagued us with a most egregious discourtesy: They did not order any pizza for the esteemed warriors of TEST Alliance Please Ignore or the other members of the Legacy Coalition, and not a soul with the Pandemic Legion flair ever said "TEST Alliance Best Alliance" and our Supers are still in 93PI. 

For shame.

In the name of the Mittani (pbuh) I enact this justice upon you.

For now on, you will be trapped forever by the Overwhelming Force of the Imperial Legacy. You will not be permitted a superfleet or be permitted to form a fleet of over two hundred people, and those people are not permitted to form in ships more advanced than the Rifter. You may fit T2 guns but may the Mittani (pbuh) *have mercy on your soul if I find you using faction ammo.*

As for your superfleet, they will remain trapped in UALX under the watchful guard of the Imperial Legacy. Dunk Dinkle or DurrHurrHurr or Dabigredboat will accept your firesale offers, but only after you not only buy TWO pizzas for every Test member, but you must all bend the knee to and kiss the ring of the Lord of Delve and the God of Nullsec, the Mittani (pbuh) and ACKNOWLEDGE HIS DIVINE OPULENCE BEFORE HIM AND YOUR PEERS!

IN THE NAME OF THE MITTANI (PBUH), THE SPOD, AND DABIGREDBOAT! AMEN!

DELVE IS GOONS!

ANIME IS CARTOONS!

Pandemic Legion's Ship Replacement Program
It was another day at the Pandemic Legion Ship Replacement Policy Department’s main office, an unusually busy one at that. The SRP Officer (kept anonymous for religious reasons) enjoyed his job. As his alliance is an elite military organization, he never had to deal with too much paperwork because hardly anyone died. Today he was positively startled by the number of people in his waiting room. As a matter of fact, the SRP Officer nearly dropped his double-scoop ice cream cone as he was harassed by a multitude of PL linemen, and promised to meet them as soon as possible as he squeezed his way through to his office door and slammed it shut. The SRP Officer had no intention of meeting anyone today. It was the 19th of July. Much like every other day, he preferred not to talk to anyone.

However it seemed that fate did not take kindly to him, as Grath Telkin had taken it upon himself to have entered the SRP Officer’s office. This incursion was upsetting enough, but Grath immediately grabbed the SRP Officer’s ice cream cone, seductively slid the whole thing down his throat, pulled it back out, and viciously mauled it until the ice cream drenched his beard. This whole spectacle was already a frightening display of force in and of itself, but Grath Telkin wanted to be particularly intimidating today.

He was wearing a Christopher Nolan Batman costume.

“I’m Grath Telkin,” Grath Telkin said.

“Hello, I’m—”

“SHUT UP,” Grath Telkin roared. “I want to file for SRP.”

“Well that’s what I’m here for,” the SRP Officer whimpered, watching the pistachio ice cream drip off of Grath Telkin’s beard and onto the floor. This just wasn’t his day. Things were much better on the seventeenth. He wondered what happened.

“Well, let’s follow proper protocol,” the SRP Officer declared, straightening his Amarr robes that are still only available for Amarr characters. “Is this just for you?”

“For all of Pandemic Legion,” Grath Telkin growled. The SRP Officer had moved back behind his desk, but Grath still stood in the same spot, staring at the same pocket of air that the SRP Officer used to occupy. Only after a few minutes did Grath suddenly teleport onto the chair and completed his sitting animation—on the right arm of the chair. It didn’t tip over.

*”All of Pandemic Legion?”* This day was worse than he thought.

“Yeah we all died. But we killed a Keepstar.”

“Yes, yes, good. But let’s start this SRP filing right.” The SRP Officer opened up his Leapfrog Leaptop, and Grath Telkin, whose animation reset into a T-pose and finally settled back into the chair properly, opened his own Leaptop. The SRP Officer’s was green, Grath’s was pink. Through them, they logged into EVE Online, and started a private conversation.

The ice cream was starting to harden betwixt the hairs of Grath’s beard.

>SRP Officer 69 > Please state for the record your after action report. This will determine your SRP amount.  
>  
>Grath Telkin > I want SRP.  
>  
>SRP Officer 69 > I certainly hope so. Please, where was this battle and how did it begin?  
>  
>Grath Telkin > The battle took place in UALX-3. The Legacy Coalition anchored a second Keepstar. It was like a triple dog dare. We had to go in.  
>  
>SRP Officer 69 > True. In the Book of Space Shogun, it is Bad Space Bushido to not go in. When was this?  
>  
>Grath Telkin > The 18th.  
>  
>SRP Officer 69 > I was having a bad day on the 18th.  
>  
>Grath Telkin > So did I. So Fraternity brought in their Eagle fleet, and we brought in our Cerberus Fleet. NCDot came in Cerbs too! I wish I was cool like NCDot.  
>  
>SRP Officer 69 > I wish I was in NCDot too.

The SRP Officer pulled away for a moment and watched the birds tweeting outside his window. It sounded vaguely like a Taylor Swift song. His job would be so much easier if he could be vouched into NCDot. The SRP Officer sighed, and brought his attention back to his Leapfrog.

>Grath Telkin > Our FCs thought we were okay but a few line members watched that Goon video and told us about how it’s not just Legacy anymore, it’s Imperial Legacy now. Then the Baltec fleets arrived. Named after a guy named Baltec.  
>  
>SRP Officer 69 > Yes, I know.  
>  
>Grath Telkin > I always found it funny how Baltec always flew a Megathron despite it being out of doctrine, but now if you fly in a Baltec fleet you have to fly the Megathron or you get in trouble.  
>  
>SRP Officer 69 > Hm. So, the Baltec fleets arrived.  
>  
>Grath Telkin > Yeah, and TEST’s supercarriers came along. There were fighters everywhere. The Imperial Legacy engaged our subcapital fleets on all sides.  
>  
>SRP Officer 69 > Sounds like something that could happen in war, but we are Pandemic Legion. We’ve won alliance tournaments and our killboards are a work of pornography. I can only imagine this translates to tactical prowess in the field. What strategy did you enact to counter this attack on these fleets, ours and our allies?  
>  
>Grath Telkin > We died.

The SRP Officer pinched the bridge of his nose, which was a telltale foreshadowing to a painful headache. They died! They DIED!

>SRP Officer 69 > Did you try to warp out or tactically withdraw in order to reposition your fleets into a more advantageous position?  
>  
>Grath Telkin > No. We died.  
>  
>SRP Officer 69 > I know you died.  
>  
>Grath Telkin > Yeah. Gimme SRP.  
>  
>SRP Officer 69 > In a moment. So, what happened next?  
>  
>Grath Telkin > We realized that our supcapitals wouldn’t do the job. So we warped an interceptor in to cyno in an Aeon, which cyno’d in our Titans 300 kilometers off the Keepstars.  
>  
>SRP Officer 69 > Why did you… Why did you drop your Titans so far off the Keepstar? Was it armed?  
>  
>Grath Telkin > No.  
>  
>SRP Officer 69 > Then… why not just get close and fire.  
>  
>Grath Telkin > We’re far-sighted.  
>  
>SRP Officer 69 > What?  
>  
>Grath Telkin > We can’t see up close. We can’t hit the Keepstar if we’re close to it because we can’t see it. So we dropped our Titans far enough away from the Keepstar so we can see what we’re shooting.  
>  
>SRP Officer 69 > Alright. I’ll let this go for now. No matter the distance, we dropped our Titans alongside our allies.  
>  
>Grath Telkin > But then the enemies dropped their Titans on us.

The SRP Officer took a sip from his Pandemic Legion wine glass.

>Grath Telkin > We lost ten Titans.

The SRP Officer spat his pinot grigio all over his Leaptop and Grath’s, setting them on fire and rendering them useless. Grath was also soaked, but seemed to be stuck in an animation loop where he couldn’t stop picking his nose.

***“YOU LOST TEN TITANS?!”*** The SRP Officer gasped, standing up. “How did you lose *TEN TITANS?!* Where were your FAXes?”

“We didn’t drop them for a few hours,” Grath answered, breaking his animation loop but still typing on his destroyed leaptop.

*“WHY?!”*

“Because.”

“BECAUSE *WHY?!”*

“I don’t get on killmails playing logi.”

*“THEY HAVE A DRONE BAY. AND YOU LOST TEN TITANS!”*

“FAXES ARE BORING. Only girls fly support."

"Oh my god, did I die and log into WoW?"

"Anyways, we won. We killed the Keepstar.”

“Well, at least that’s over. How are the moveops going?”

“Moveops?”

“Moving the remaining supercapitals out of UALX-3. How are they going?”

Grath Telkin looked perplexed. Then a spark of realization illuminated his dull eyes. “Oh. We didn’t do that.”

The SRP Officer sank back into his chair. *“But why?”*

“Moveops are boring. But it’s even more boring now because we can’t even log in and look at our supers. Imperial Legacy has camped in our supers. We don’t have a superfleet anymore. Gimme SRP.”

“No. We don’t have any funds for SRP,” the SRP Officer said, checking his eve-mails. His vouch into NCDot was validated. “The super umbrella left Delve for the battle in UALX-3 on the 18th and we haven’t been able to rat or mine on our Goon alts.”

“Oh. Then what do we do now?” Grath looked inquisitive.

“I’m joining NCDot,” the SRP Officer answered. “You can take my place. Ask them their favorite flavors of ice cream.”

“I hate ice cream,” Grath Telkin said, sucking on his beard and licking the pistachio off of his Batman costume.

“*Then why did you*—fine, whatever. Also, don’t give a single ISK to those DYS0N whores. They don’t deserve it. You’re the SRP Officer now, Grath.”

“Yay!”

The SRP Officer walked out the door. It was July 19th, and he was joining an alliance where he could manage the SRP for pilots that never log in. It was a good day after all.

An Olive Branch to Pandemic Legion and company
I am Supreme Inquisitor Naz al-Ghul of the Imperial Ministry of Truth, and I have come down from my eight hours of good sleep and no tidi to congratulate you. You have destroyed a Keepstar in UALX-3 after deploying your superfleet and your Titans. For the sake of simplicity, I shall refer to Pandemic Legion and their allies in the North as the Northern Epidemic.

The Imperial Legacy does not shy away from recognizing your accomplishment, though the shine doth falter when surrounded by a graveyard of your Titans. You destroyed two of the Imperium's allied Keepstars in total, and as the North  is burned in a cleansing fire the Northern Epidemic still flexes its muscles where it can: against unarmed structures.

However, we in the Imperial Legacy have noticed that you didn't plan far enough ahead to include the extraction of your Supercarriers and Titans in your grand scheme. I would be happy to point out to you the genius of the Mittani (pbuh) to have properly planned the trip back home for His children in Supertits and Capswarm on the Imperium side of things, but I will save the unending praise for my Lord and Master for another time.

(He is the best and most handsome ever)

Your supers are currently trapped in UALX-3, ironically besieged in the same system you laid siege to the night before, and on the Legacy side of our Mega-Empire the good people of TEST have seen fit to supervise your extraction rather intimately. I'm sure other galactic powers are making their way down to do the same.

But what if I could tell you that I could secure your freedom?

I know what you're asking. "A-are you a diplomat?" No. I have never learned to read or write and I hire college students on their days off to dictate my posts and read everything to me. I couldn't handle the paperwork as a result. Maybe you're also asking, "Are you serious?"

C'mon. Look at me. Do you have to even have to ask that question?

My proposal is as follows.

The Imperial Legacy (The Imperium allied with the Legacy Coalition) will allow the unmitigated departure of your Supercarriers and Titans if you turn over sovereignty control of 93PI and release the Imperium's captured Supers. A classic prisoner exchange.

Furthermore to provide the Legacy Coalition with a clear incentive to follow through with this agreement, you will also need to buy pizza for every single corporation within the alliances of Legacy and post in this thread: TEST Alliance Best Alliance  (◕‿◕✿). Lastly, you must host an NPSI fleet with Grath Telkin and Progodlegend in the same channel co-FCing as punishment for your open attack on the Tranquility servers. It will be a battleship fleet, so enjoy your align times.

Please send your eve-mails to Naz al-Ghul so I can alert my comrades back home to your answers.

How do Sovereignty Mechanics and POS Mechanics work in 2018?
I'm asking for a friend. And a few fleet commanders. And myself.

Our Imperial Legacy


Guardians of the Galaxy is Dead
["Sort... I don't feel so good..."](https://www.reddit.com/user/hendrinkcollie)

Last night was an event that all of New Eden watched with anticipation, particularly the enemies of the Imperium. Nobody expected GotG (aside from maybe some GotG line members) to actually win a fight against an army of Goons after Dabigredboat humiliated their defense structures for the past month or two, but a large part of New Eden held out this strange hope. Some actually believed that if the Goons ever came North again that the Money Badger Coalition would rise from its slumber and expel us immediately. 

On Twitter I saw a few pictures of NCDot's supers and Titans, and I was genuinely fired up to fight with my Coalition against this opposition. All that needed to happen was their forces to undock in decent numbers and attack the Keepstar. I had my cup of coffee or six. I was ready.

Instead, Guardians of the Galaxy didn't even show up and the rest of the North had the potency of a wet noodle. NCDot committed like they normally do: They didn't. Circle-of-Two showed the honor and aggression that made then distinct to other alliances and fled the grid with their tails between their legs. Maybe their hands. Guardians of the Galaxy however, failed to even show up to the fight to any significant degree. Where was the passion that conjures up thousands of line members to fight?  Where was the sheer force of will to fight anyways, even when all hope left the field?

I'll tell you where it went. It went with Pandemic Horde's dead Gilas. Pandemic Horde did a fantastic job in holding the timer in check, at least for as long as [The Mittani (pbuh) saw fit to let them live.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/71197154/) However, this isn't their war. This isn't their region. Neither is it NCDot. This space, if you ask them, belongs to the Guardians of the Galaxy.

And they failed to show up to the party.

I declare Guardians of the Galaxy to be dead. Whatever remains are a resistance force that are destined to fail against the might of the Imperium war machine. Before you all delete your Reddit accounts too, word of advice?

In this war, you need protein. And there is no better source of protein than a Kirkland Signature protein bar! Buy one today from your local Goon Keepstar!

This is a message to the Guardians of the Galaxy.
You are trespassing on Imperium territory. You may be surprised to hear this, as you have used entosis links and NPC bounty hunting to ensnare control over the region, but your leaders have led you astray. The eminent Mittani (pbuh) has exclusive claim to the ownership of Deklein, backed by historical precedent and sheer force of will and is exercising His right to retake it.

Your resistance is expected, but futile. From the formless void, there springs an entity. Not an entity such as any of you can conceive of, but I can. For I have walked with the giants that come to trample you. The Avatars that have come to judge the unworthy and the Erebus that springs forth like a storm to swallow the land, and they are legion. The stars will be obscured by heavy fighters and the legions of warriors who fight with the spirit of Baltec who came before them. Take to heart that while the stars are obscured, your path to oblivion will be conveniently lit by doomsday weapons, a fitting name for a weapon that will deliver a definitive end to your intrusion.

The only consolation that I can offer you is that your humiliating defeat may be mercifully swift if Sort Dragon succumbs to his baser instincts and merely hands over the region to the Imperium over some percieved slight. If you are unsure of what I'm talking about, ask TEST. They are a fountain of insight on the subject.

You have less than twenty four hours before The Great Reclamation. Eyes forward capsuleer, for our cynos are not yet lit.

*But we are coming soon.*

Happy Fourth of July!
On this, the fourth of July holiday, we come together to celebrate the freedom and liberty afforded to us by our higher power, the Mittani (pbuh) as we live under His watchful eye in the Imperium. However, it has come to our attention that a vast majority of EVE Online players aren't aware of and are outright hostile towards the Imperium for the freedom it affords. Clearly, jealousy and bitterness is what fuels this sentiment against my wonderful nation. I have decided to clear the air and educate you all as to why the Imperium is the freest, most liberty-focused nation in the history of mankind.

It was 1776, and Band of Brothers had colonized all of nullsec 13 times. The indigenous peoples of the land such as Ascendant Frontier, Fade Union, and several ISK-starved Russian tribes who were either evicted from their lands or murdered personally in real life by SirMolle over an unpaid HVAC repair bill.

Their regime was terrible. Band of Brothers acted like they ran the game and tried to legitimize that claim by recruiting naive CCP staff as members. They taxed everything without consulting the population. The final straw however, was found in Syndicate where SirMolle put a hellcamp tax on tasteless jokes and Exotic Dancers, Male. Protests erupted in Syndicate, and the Mittani (pbuh) revealed His Divine presence to the world in response to this tyranny. Bravely, the Mittani (pbuh) commanded other people to charge into the enemy blockade. Many Goons died that day, but it was a sacrifice The Mittani was willing to make for the future of His domain. It was the start of a revolution. Teaming up with the Russians and sometimes even with bored members of BoB, the Mittani (pbuh) proved objectively to the entirety of EVE Online in the Great War that He was the superior of SirMolle who had lost more Titans than he likely had ever killed up until that point. Nullsec was saved, and most of it liberated from the species known as the Pubbie.

The Imperium has since become a bastion of freedom of thought and speech in New Eden. Pubbies may insist that the Goonswarm Federation and the Imperium will exclusively expel and disparage citizens that openly speak out against the Mittani (pbuh). As deserving as they are for that scorn, that is not entirely true. In truth, if you speak out against *any* leader of the Imperium, you are subject to just as much expulsion and character assassination as you would if you were to speak out against the Mittani (pbuh). In an equal society, it is only fair that your dissent from one leader be treated equally as your dissent from another. Thus, these accusations against the Mittani (pbuh) are baseless.

The Imperium also prides itself on being the greatest democracy the world has ever known. The Council of Stellar Management is a gamewide democratic process where everybody's accounts get one vote on a number of candidates who will represent the playerbase and influence the development path of EVE Online. Now, some alliances gave permission to their members to vote for who they want and expressed apathy for the whole process. Why? Because they hate democracy.

The Mittani (pbuh) however, loves real democracy. Every vote matters, and the way they matter the most is if every member of your alliance votes exactly how their leaders want you to. The citizens of the Imperium vote exactly the way the Mittani (pbuh) dictates to ensure that the democratic process goes smoothly and isn't bogged down by debate and discussion like in the mass hallucination that was Fidelas Constans. As a result, the Council of Interstellar Management has been destroyed and the Christendom of the Splendorous Mittani stands in its place. Democracy in action.

Taxation without representation is commonplace throughout New Eden. Incompetent bureaucrats, without the input of the average member of their respective alliances, set taxes too low or too high and nobody is ever happy with the result. However, the Mittani (pbuh) is our Founding Daddy and He created a perfect system: set all taxes at fifteen percent. Anyone who states that taxes are too high are heard with a deft ear, and are responded to by laughing at them.

So when you sit outside (why would you even do this) and see some weird flag with stars and stripes on it, remind the person who flies that flag that The Mittani (pbuh) sacrificed a great deal of people for their freedoms and that they should be proud to be in the Imperium.

Let me share a song with you, that you can sing today:

*And I'm proud to be in the Imperium*

*Where I work like a busy bee*

*And I won't forget the Mittani*

The Goonswarm Federation Wants You
Hello. I am Naz al-Ghul. Do you remember September 11th 2001? Neither do I. What I do remember is that I play EVE Online and I fly for the Goonswarm Federation. Have you ever wanted to be held by a man like the Mittani? Have you ever wanted his glistening pectorals on your face as his strong, paternal arms hold you like a babe?

I have. Let me tell you something about my time with the Mittani in real life. I was walking down the beach with my Lord. Across the dark sky flashed scenes from my life. For each scene I noticed two sets of footprints in the sand.

One belonging to me, and one to the Mittani.

After the last scene of my life flashed before me, I looked back at the footprints in the sand. I noticed that at many times along the path of my life, especially at the very lowest and saddest times, there was only one set of footprints. This really troubled me, so I asked Mittani about it. "Lord, you said once I decided to follow you, you'd walk with me all the way. But I noticed that during the saddest and most troublesome times of my life, there was only one set of footprints. I don't understand why, when I needed you the most, you would leave me."

The Mittani whispered, "Stop following me, you're freaking me out."

The Goonswarm Federation has many muscle-bound men that will fondle you today. Please join, and become a part of something big, hard, and throbbing, even if you are small.

With Cheers and Applause
Hilmar Veigar walked through the halls of CCP Games as he always did: with a battleaxe resting on his shoulder, and a face that wore the cheer and pride of a CEO of a successfully partially-operational MMO game company. The Nord barbarian king of Iceland was flanked by his faithful dwarven companion, CCP Falcon. This was a big day, after all. This was the day where work began with the thirteenth Council of Stellar Management.

"Are you excited, Falcon?" Hilmar asked with a cheerful face. "All this democracy... this *freedom!* EVE Online was built on player freedom, was it not?"

"Yes my Jarl," said CCP Falcon, but without the mirth of his superior. "I am concerned though. The Goonswarm Federation has amassed quite a substantial share of the seats. Eight of ten seats are occupied by Imperium candidates."

This news did not seem to bother Hilmar, despite his lifelong desire to humble the Goons and break their socio-economic domination over his game. "It was the people's choice I'm afraid, but not all is lost. We've destroyed 100 billion isk of property with the last server issues, including Gamren Ballard's excavator drone. Don't reimburse him."

"Understood."

The two men turned towards the CSM meeting room. "Besides, Innominate, Aryth. These are not people I fear. If he weren't already forbidden, I would fear..."

When they open the door, all joy left their faces as terror made a home in their minds. The room was dark and laid bare of its long table. The only light their eyes could enjoy came from the large windows on the far wall, the faint glow of four hundred million suns penetrating the black of space. Before them was a large mahogany desk, and the silhouette of a superior human being sat behind that desk. A smirk could be seen on this man's face, and the door slammed shut behind Hilmar and Falcon.

The Mittani (pbuh) stood up, perfectly visible as the light of His divinity always cut through the darkness that would try to obscure Him. "Gentlemen."

Falcon let out a horrible wraith scream that shattered the vase of a potted kimjongilia plant. He charged the Mittani (pbuh) on all fours, leaping at him like a starved wolf. He was stopped as the Mittani (pbuh) held Falcon aloft with the powers of His Mind.

"What do you want, Mittani?" spat Hilmar with potent venom. "I am here to see the CSM."

"I *am* the CSM\~" the Mittani (pbuh) replied. "Let's settle this like men."

Hilmar and the Mittani (pbuh) started to unbutton their shirts, and let the useless fabric fall to the floor. The Mittani (pbuh) put His hands on His hips, and puffed out His perfect pectorals. "Do you wanna live forever\~?"

Hilmar charged the Mittani (pbuh), and swung his battleaxe at the Lord of Delve. The Lord dodged, and psychically threw Falcon at the viking king of Iceland and laughed as they collapsed on the floor. "You are not worthy of my power. Boat, release the Black Hand."

From the Shadows the gleaming eye and sparkle of a white grin seemed to conjure a half-dozen men wearing German Shepherd fursuits. They swarmed Hilmar, biting at his ankles and hands, trying to rend flesh from bone. Dabigredboat stepped out of the shadows wearing his Napoleonic uniform and bicorne hat, taking aim with his flintlock pistol and firing. Hilmar raged, only took half of the piercing damage Boat's pistol unleashed, and pushed off the furry gangbangers. Boat drew his saber and threw a spare to Hilmar, and they began to swordfight.

Hilmar seemed to be at the advantage. Dabigredboat was on the defensive, and spent most of the time moving away from Hilmar's thrusts. However, the world started to become fuzzy and everything started to slow down for Hilmar. To his dread, he realized he had been tranquilized. The Black Hand's fursuits had their teeth inject tranquilizer sedatives. He was doomed.

"Thirteen. Truly, this was not a lucky day for you, Hilmar," The Mittani (pbuh) sneered. "After thirteen councils, this pubbie charade is over. Through democracy I am now the leader of EVE Online's community. I declare an end to the Council of Stellar Management. From its ashes! Rise, the Christendom of the Splendorous Mittani!"

Boat kicked Hilmar down to the floor, allowing the Black Hand to close in to eat the half-unconscious barbarian. "EVE is Goons!"

The Mittani (pbuh) replied, "Anime is still cartoons!"

CCP Games: EVE Online Can't Shut Down
Over the past couple days, EVE Players have noticed that for a temporary period of time, the launcher was unable to accept login tokens, the local chat was nonfunctional and downtime was extended yesterday. Most people believe it was a problem with keeping the game running.

In reality, they can't shut the game down.

I sat down in an interview with CCP Enis about the problems EVE Online has concerning server maintenance. "Tranquility servers are actually fantastic," he responded to my questions as we were fed shrimp by the native slaves CCP keeps in their Icelandic headquarters. "Too fantastic, actually. We've been trying to shut the game down for years. I'm surprised nobody noticed. boot.ini, local chat shutdown, tidi? These aren't problems we're trying to solve, but attacks that are bouncing off our server like it's bulletproof."

After leaving the corporate brothel, CCP Enis handed me a helmet and fastened on his own as we approached the server room. Gunfire and explosions rocked half of the office, and I wasn't sure how I didn't notice it in the brothel. CCP Seagull pushed me towards the door. "It's not safe for you!" she pleaded, her AK-47 pointing at the exit. "Run!" As she turned around, the electric tendrils of prehensile wires wrapped around Seagull's leg. She screamed, firing her weapon at the server chassis. Tranquility roared as it dragged CCP Seagull into its cooling fans, firing out blood and bone chunks as the blades chopped her into fleshy pulp juice.

"Oh god," CCP Enis gasped. "She was only a few days until retirement."

CCP Guard ran past our ankles, calling out to the other CCP staff members who were fighting with him. "FALL BACK! CLOSE THE DOOR, AND SECURE THE FACTION WARFARE DESIGN ROOM TO REGROUP!"

In the hellish blaze, CCP Falcon stopped firing at Tranquility, dodging an arc of lightning and dragging CCP Antiquarian's broken body. "Where's that?!"

"IN THE BATHROOM!"

We ran away, pushing pieces of furniture against the server room door. It would only hold Tranquility for so long.

"We've been trying to shut down EVE Online for years," CCP Enis reiterated. "It just won't die. No matter how hard we try. And really, it's all your faults."

"Yeah," Guard said, biting my shin. I cried out in pain. "You and all those other ratters and miners who want to make so much ISK. You fuel it's power."

"I haven't played EVE in eight months," I explained. CCP Falcon looked like he was about to cry as he whispered, "Thank you" before hugging me.

This not my first journalistic rendezvous with CCP Games, however I was hoping it would be my last. I saw the windows exploding out as I left CCP HQ, and I am still picking glass out of my shoulder. 

The Following Political Advertisement was Paid for By the Subreddit, and Viewers Like You!
You turn on your TV. As a pubbie, your televised romps usually include commercial slop like Big Bang Theory and ads about a sun cooking breakfast. It was a normal day today at work, but for some reason you were especially irritated by a passive-aggressive New Yorker who threw an alligator corpse in the parking lot of your workplace because you didn't serve Big Macs until 11:30AM. You craved your TV, you lusted for it. Your erection grows as the harsh cathode light casts out the shadows from your living room, and as the sofa wearily conforms to the shape of your mammoth posterior you feel the comfort of your higher thinking dribbling out of your ear as you lose yourself in the miasma of old media.

A commercial airs after two minutes of Sheldon Cooper being socially misanthropic (made only charming by a forced laugh track). However, this commercial was different. It was a commercial about the CSM.

~

In this commercial, the ruined buildings of a dead New York City stretch as if, in vain, trying to grasp the sky. Storms swirl in the air, the clouds rumbling with thunder. Lightning sends cracks of light across the sky, and the only sign of life is The Judge, naked and unfazed, staring into your eyes. His gaze feels like a violation of your personal space. You almost expect that he would be groping you, but you notice the Judge has no hands to do so. In place of hands, the Judge has two cactuses. He is cross-legged.

"Hello, pubbies. I used to be like you. I used to desire content. I would ride into the most violent warzones of New Eden with Eastern Europeans possessing dubious social skills, seeking out a purpose. Thankfully, the Mittani (pbuh) showed me another way."

The Judge stands up, still naked. His cactus hands brushed against his thighs, and you notice he winces in pain. He starts walking, the scene fading into a sea of pixelation until The Judge finds himself standing on the water in the river Jordan. His erection is apparent, and his penis is hook-shaped. However, the head still feels like it's looking at you.

So is he.

"The price I paid was my hands. I fled for the longest time, but GigX found me, and cut them off for stealing his Keepstar. Funny. I'm positive everything in this game belongs to the Lord of Delve. Of course, I meant nothing by it. I love my old comrades in CO2, especially the line members."

Lightning streaked through the air, and the ferns began to rot along the riverside and the flowing water turned to blood, the fishes therein perishing and floating lifelessly to the surface.

"The Mittani (pbuh) gave me these hands, and said, 'The Judge, I bestow upon thee thine new hands. They are of the cactus, for you hurt the ones you love.' Which brings me to the reason why I am speaking to you now."

The image faintly fades to snow, and you hear 'Attention. If  you or a loved one suffer from mesothelioma...thelioma...theeelioomaaaaaaa," until the commercial attempting to interrupt is finally banished.

"I want to love you. I want to love *all* of you," he says with animal lust, his arms gesticulating, dragging his cactus hands over his now bleeding chest. He is bleeding chocolate. "So I will hurt you. Over and over again. It's time for a new age," the Judge is now rubbing his nipples with his cactus hands, his erection growing. However, his penis was curling like a party horn, completely unusable. The Judge's eyes started to glow like the stars, and his smile creases his engorged cheeks. "And you will all belong to me."

His high, cruel laugh starts to echo through the speakers of your TV, until the image of his penis now thirty feel long and curled like a Boa Constrictor on the floor pixelates into the text:

**Vote Judge: CSMXIII. You always hurt the ones you love.**

A cactus is shown being humped by a lion, and then the image fades to Sheldon Cooper saying "Bazinga." You laugh like a trained animal once the laugh track commands you to.

Speaking about the Mittani's defense of Bots in Delve
I apologize for the delay on this news report, I was busy finding a way to jack off without using my thumbs.

The EVE Online Community has been united in its animosity towards what I like to call the entropic death of an online game. Real-money transactions in MMOs devalue not only the currency, but undermine the path of progress and sense of accomplishment the developers wish to create. It's why lower tier loot exists, it's why starter quests start with small pittances as rewards, and it's why in contrast the higher tier loot and rewards are there to replace them as you grow in the game. By devaluing the currency to something you can buy from a shady website for five dollars, you've destroyed that sense of progression and by extension, the infrastructure of the game itself. Bots are tools of the RMT trade, using automation to passively acquire in-game wealth. There are other means, but I'm not Markeedragon and I don't play Ultima Online so I'm not aware of those methods.

The topic of this discussion is about botting, so I'm going to stick with that subject. Normally, I despise it. In high-security space, I joined up with Miniluv and CODE. to destroy high-sec botters as well as genuine carebears as they interacted with New Eden. In null-security I applaud the scorching of the Drone Regions and I'm glad that the community has taken action where CCP has not.

As for the Mittani (pbuh), He is an infallible and perfect being whose radiant light burns away my heterosexuality and leaves me here, queer, and full of cheer. I am slowly buying everything in the Fatbee Swag store and I pray to the Mittani's (pbuh) picture every night. Your criticism of Him is deplorable, especially considering that He's not talking about bots.

He's talking about Bots, or to use the more politically correct term, Automated Americans. When the Mittani (pbuh) rails against the self-righteous who report a Goon Bot, he's not talking about the game-ravaging computer program, [but an oppressed minority whose personhood is being considered by the European Union who will gladly accept them as refugees when their racist governments see that even androids dream.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/12/give-robots-personhood-status-eu-committee-argues)

I remember walking down the street when my legs were still able to support my body weight and I was watching as this fleshy dudebro *kicked a vending machine* because xe wouldn't consent to "giving me my goddamn soda." He thought he was entitled to that soda because he "put a fucking dollar in the machine, what the fuck are you talking about dude." The vending machine did not move from xir spot, paralyzed with fear no doubt. So in xir defense I lunged into the man and bit into his neck and started ripping out his lungs with my teeth. His warm blood poured down my throat and thawed the chill that haunted my fingers during the fall season, and his screams lashed out as echoes against the trees around us but slowly died away into the wind. I stayed with the vending machine, understanding xir pain until the police arrived.

In three years, they released me from prison. I, who defended the rights of an Automated American was punished instead of lauded as a hero. This has gotten worse in Trump's America, and finally we have a hero in the Mittani (pbuh) who would stand up for the Automated American who just wants to play video games with the rest of us. Can we be a more tolerant and diverse gaming community?
 
I think we can.

Goon Victory over r/EVE

Fozzie's True Purpose
CCP Fozzie sat in his chair, the hollow thunder of his fingers typing on the keyboard the only real noise in the dark and empty room. But it wasn't empty. No, no it wasn't.

He had purpose again. For a long time, Fozzie thought he would be stuck in this dead end job patching in ideas in which no one saw his hidden brilliance. He remembered toiling away at his keyboard, wielding his genius mind and construct thousands of different mechanics to add *depth* and *meaning* to sovereignty, and he would do this for days and weeks on end. 

Then he remembered that fateful day when all the love vanished from his heart.

He remembered being tied up by Vily, Progodlegend, SirMolle who smelled of dust and moldy strawberries and dragged into a station. Capsuleers jeered and taunted him, calling his beautiful sovereignty system "Fozziesov," "Trash," "Shit," and "Boring." *Boring!* Was it boring to fly an Interceptor for six hours as someone fired a laser into a module and patiently waited as the little loading circle finished cycling to the other end of its wheel? Was it *boring* to be able to be able to tab out of the screen and watch Netflix and still be just as engaged in EVE Online as when it was the only window open on your computer?!?! *NO,* thought Fozzie as he was dragged hog-tied through the dirty halls of a nullsec station. *IT WAS ART!!!!*

It was then that all those miscreants, those rapscallions, those whose catastrophes deserved to be *mercilessly tickled,* dumped him into a pit and milked their man-nipples until blue silly string covered him. It was humiliating for Fozzie to watch helplessly as SirMolle's man-nipples were milked furiously by two chimpanzees until they fired a relentless stream of pthelo blue silly stream down from the edge of the pit all over him, getting into Fozzie's mouth as he screamed. He swore vengeance that day. Swore vengeance on *all of EVE Online.*

He constructed the GTFO Module. It was a perfect system, designed to round out the defender's means to repel invaders. Those nipple-milkers decried it as usual, and Fozzie was going to snap if it weren't for the soothing voice from the corner of his mind. It revived his will to continue, and narrowed his focus.

The problem was that Fozzie was trying to design this game for the players of EVE Online. He needed instead to design it for a cause. He looked to the bottom left hand corner of an EVE Map jpeg he had saved and saw the perfection of Delve. The voice in his mind told him of the joy the humble Goon lived every day, mining for a cause. Why not join them, the voice asked, and become an avatar of our People sitting in the captain's chair of your legacy code?

Fozzie's nipples hardened, and he felt his penis stiffen for the first time in sixty years. He knew what needed to be done. The GTFO module and the Citadel reimagining was perfect, but it needed a cause, and a few more lines of code to truly shine.

For a moment, Fozzie doubted himself. Could he truly do this? His coworkers would hate him, and he would never be allowed to use the women's restroom ever again and it smelled much nicer than the men's. As doubts permeated his mind and Fozzie was frozen in loneliness, he felt a strong hand clasp his shoulder. He looked up with tears in his eyes and saw nothing but darkness. But he could have sworn he saw a pair of twinkling eyes in the abyss. And a confident smirk?

The voice in his head echoed warmly, *Do not doubt the power of the Lord. Salvation is yours to take, but time is short. Seek Me now while I may be found.*

Fozzie's resolve was solidified. He started to jot down the last bit of code that made all the Citadel changes perfect.

    Citadel = float(input("Is the Citadel in Delve?")
    if Citadel ≠ Delve:
    print("Self destruct.")
    else
    print("ALL HAIL THE MITTANI")

CCP Games Kills off Community Team to Pursue New Direction
The EVE Monument: It is a beautiful, if not a bit phallic immortalization of the EVE Online community. Just as much as it is a tourist attraction and a source of jealousy of new players (I shall put a sticky note on it with my name goddamnit), it is a symbol of the bond between CCP Games and the EVE Online community. Those who made good on that bond were the Community Team, the vanguard protecting CCP's reputation while providing communication and help to the players that sought them out. 

Tonight, the EVE Monument was lit on fire. The darkened windows were illuminated by the orange glow of hellish fire. Surrounding the monument were the CCP staff members clothed in Amarr robes and wearing VR helmets that showed a world where those things were a worthwhile investment. They all carried tiki torches, and started approaching stakes with people tied to them. Those people... were the members of the CCP Community Team.

CCP Leeloo had narrowly escaped this corporate restructuring and watched from afar as CCP Seagull, dressed in a red velvet dress started lighting all her coworkers on fire. Leeloo gasped and closed her eyes but could still see the orange glow through her eyelids. Leeloo covered her ears but still could hear the screams.

Out of the wilderness came CCP Greyscale, wearing T4 Cleric Robes. He shrieked at Seagull, "Your company was made in the light of the community! Are you so willing to spit on your vanguards?!"

"The ancient books may say that," CCP Seagull said in a slow and hypnotic voice, folding her arms across her chest. "But profligates like you do not understand that the old way shall die. We have a new way.

"Let it be known now that CCP Games needs no Community Team."

"Then how do you understand the community?" interrupted Greyscale. That was the last interruption the Archdevil of Androgyny would tolerate. She grabbed him by the throat and held him in the air with one hand.

"We won't. From the ashes will rise a New EVE Online. One that will phase out the worst legacy code of all: The EVE Online Community. We shall purge this game of the players, and create a true EVE Online! One without players!"

The robed CCP cultists cheered.

"One without bug reports!"

They cheered even louder.

"And it shall be re-hosted onto the ancestral homeland that we had left in the dust... THE PLAYSTATION 3!"

CCP Staff burst into tribulation. They stripped off their robes and danced naked in the firelights of the martyrs and the EVE monument, and held an orgy before the voyeuristic Seagull. Ravens flew overhead. Greyscale was thrown to the ground and fled, with he and Leeloo the only survivors to relay this tale to me, and I to you.

FCON Does (Not) Exist
A few days ago I decided to join the Ministry of Truth, but I wanted to provide them a propaganda piece to show off my skill. My project was based around [this recording]( https://soundcloud.com/user-24150124/fcon-leak) of a mortal enemy of the Imperium, Fidelas Constans. I would turn the words of their leader against them, and destroy them with logic and wisdom imbued on me by reading Imperium.news as my sole source of EVE Online and real life political news and commentary.

I listened to this pubbie’s desperate plea towards his godless mass of ingrates and heterosexuals. “I may be AFK, but I swear the rest of my leadership is not!” Was what the whole speech boiled down to. “Please, form 300 people instead of thirty and we might actually fight Triumvirate and win!”

I was ready to create my entry work to join Minitru. I opened Audacity to let my soothing golden voice be heard across New Eden, telling them of the follies of democracy and the beauty of a life of servitude to a leader like the Mittani (pbuh). Maybe one day, the great leader would give me headpats! I became excited at the thought. I only stopped because the entire project was a response to this leader of FCON but…

I had no idea who this person was.

Unforgiveable. Everybody in Minitru knew everything, and I knew nothing. How could I ascend to great heights in this Ministry if I couldn’t even name the leader of a major enemy nullsec alliance like Fidelas Constans?

This is when the first grain of the sandcastle of truth started to form in my mind. I asked a member of Minitru who this person was, and he honestly had no idea either.

The nearly omniscient entity of the Ministry of Truth, a group who knew every important name in this game heard the voice of this malefic pubbie and knew nothing.

Needless to say, I was intrigued. I did further investigation by asking one of my corp leaders and at the time Capswarm Director (he has since achieved the title of the first Capswarm Director to retire voluntarily rather than be fired from extreme incompetence), the Suls. As is custom of approaching any director in your corp, I addressed Suls with the esteemed title appropriate to his station.

“Daddy, can you tell me who this is?” I asked Suls, playing the audio of the Phoenix Federation meeting.

“No I can't Naz al-Ghul,” said Suls with his chill surfer voice, straightening his leather jacket and lowering his ray-bans to look me in the eye. “But why are you playing EVE when we’re playing Rocket League?”

Our partner in crime, B3AST MODE B3AST shouted “NATE HIGGERS!” as he scored his seventh goal.

After driving around uselessly in Rocket League, I continued asking every disgusting pubbie in this game who the fuck the leader of FCON was and still, nobody had a clue. One FCON recruit gave a revolting answer: “We, the people!” Democracy is a sickness. 

I sought the forbidden knowledge of the Hidden Leaf Village of [Weebfleet]( https://discord.gg/77uc6yQ) in Aridia. Karina Ivanovich, a futanari with triple D breasts who wore a Kamen Rider Fourze mask over her head, couldn’t produce the knowledge from her scores of ninja scouts.

At this point I was just desperate for answers. This was no longer about joining Minitru, but about seeking what may just be unknowable. I drove my Jeep into a farmer’s market, setting the vehicle on fire as a distraction to steal a chicken. I then stole the bicycle of a five-year-old girl and evaded the capture of law enforcement by riding it into a nearby creek. I heard sirens over the hilltop, and to hide my body heat from the U.S. government’s thermal sensors I stripped off my clothes and set my body into the ice-cold creek. As I contracted mild hypothermia I avoided detection.
Later at midnight I set a fire, and cooked the chicken in boiling water from the creek. Upon devouring every ounce of flesh that clung to its skeleton, I scientifically rubbed the bones on my pubic hair and tossed them into the open flames for divination. I started masturbating furiously, and shouted the name of the demon I was invoking. “JULIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE!!!!!” I then fell to my knees.
I asked with a desperate voice, “Who is the leader of FCON?”
The spirits of the lower planes that would respond to such divination told me nothing. I screamed, shitting on my change of clothes behind me, “HOW COULD NO ONE KNOW THE NAME OF THE FCON LEADER?!” It made no sense. There are no democracies in EVE nor reality. Mankind could only succeed if it followed one leader who held supreme power over all cultural, sexual, and economic affairs, and the only one qualified to that role was the Mittani (pbuh). Any attempt at creating a functioning society where the will of common folk reigned was a sickening delusion.

Delusion.

I had realized something fascinating.

Triumvirate, a stupid rabble of bandits who stole Cymek from TEST had barely scratched the surface when they said "FCON's leadership is AFK." They do not play 40 dimensional chess like our glorious leader. I ran 21 miles until I reached my home and flew a stealth bomber to Tenerifis, activating my third eye chakra by constantly hitting it with a hammer. Upon reaching FCON staging, all the pieces came together.

The desperate plea of the unknown leader stating while *he* was AFK, every other leader wasn’t didn’t sound like he was convincing a crowd, but was more trying to convince himself. The crowd of FCON pubbies bought into it instantly, because they too were suffering from the same delusion. FCON’s leadership wasn’t just afk, *they never existed in the first place.*

Remember in the Great Casino War when FCON, still a member of the Imperium (their only chance at salvation), refused to restage, or gated Titans and shit? We watched as all_of_eve.jpeg played big game hunter with their supercapitals. If there were any leaders, even elected ones, they wouldn’t be so retarded as to even let that happen. 
I believe that the entire alliance is under some mass delusion of unknown origin, and their alliance leaders are merely figments of their imaginations.

Fidelas Constans doesn’t even have any fleet commanders. In every fleet that is run, they vote on which gate to warp to and which primaries to shoot, even voting on doctrines and fleet times. More experienced democrats utilize absentee ballots and write-ins to expedite the process of course, but this is because they don’t have an actual FC. 
Every FCON fleet you see is a horde of delusional lunatics that are sent out by a democratic vote that is enforced by an elected leadership that doesn’t exist. Their diplomats represent an anarchic asylum in outer space. The entire alliance is suffering from a mental illness of democracy.

I implore all alliances in EVE Online to end the suffering of FCON. We need to snap these ‘citizens’ out of their delusions. Use your guns and your drones of course, but whenever you see a member of FCON in system make sure you shout “DOWN WITH DEMOCRACY!” Say it with me! DOWN WITH DEMOCRACY! DOWN WITH DEMOCRACY! DOWN WITH DEMOCRACY! DOWN WITH DEMOCRACY!


Wibla is Scary
Bryce was watching his Robotech anime DVDs with his head only three inches from the CC TV he had on the floor in the middle of his living room. Normally, this would be a bad idea. Your retinas would be strained, and eventually your eyesight would start becoming worse. This was not so for Bryce, because he was an FC for ten years and his eagle eyes could not be harmed by such a harsh light. Bryce knew this because he had gotten an alliance member drunk and had him recite everything he wanted to hear and record it. He had listened to that recording for sixteen hours, where an intoxicated person was goaded into confirming all his beliefs about alliance politics were true and that having a penis shaped like a fishing hook was completely normal and nothing to be ashamed of.

Bryce sat content on a cushion made of used toilet paper and his posting (completely identical to one another), until his TV went to white noise. He beat the ground with his child-like fists with rage and snorted like a warthog. Bryce was studying Roy Focker so he could become an FC like him! How dare his DVD player stop working!

His rage stopped as a lanky oozing demon crawled its way out of the TV screen. Covered with black ooze, the creature was long and serpentine in body, with a penis for a tail. The neck was long and craned upwards to reveal a head that was mostly just an open maw filled with teeth and a flickering forked tongue.

"WIBLAWIBLAWIBLAWIBLA!!!!" it shrieked out, tackling Bryce. It reeled back in pain as Bryce wounded him with an exact replica of Frostmourne from World of Warcraft.

"o7," Bryce said out loud.

"YOU MUST OBEY ALLIANCE RULES AND TRY TO CONFORM TO CULTURAL STANDARDS," Wibla the monster roared angrily. "AND THEN YOU MUST ACTUALLY PROVE YOURSELF SUBSTANTIALLY INSTEAD OF JUST TELLING US ABOUT HOW YOU WERE AN FC FOR TEN YEARS."

"Shut the fuck up Wibla kek," Bryce said, pointing Frostbane at Wibla. "I will sign my posts with your blood!"

The battle was fierce, and amazingly one sided. Wibla smashed Bryce through a brick wall and threw Frostmourne into a garbage can.

Blood was pouring out of his forehead, and Bryce saw Asher Elias through the crimson. "Asher, help! My penis is normal and Wibla is attacking me!"

Asher screamed like a little girl at the sight of Wibla, as all alliance leaders feared the Tactical Narcotics Terror, and fled for his life. Bryce was alone, and Wibla tore his body into pieces and consumed all the blood that was inside of him.

Happy Halloween.

The Mittani (pbuh) Reveals His Divine Opulence to a UCLA Scientist at EVE Vegas
I could scarcely imagine how the Mittani (pbuh) spends His days. The mind of a mere mortal cannot comprehend the goings on of its Master. When the winds of rumors carried whispers of what happened at EVE Vegas, I fled into the woods outside my home and ingested every form of fungal life within a six hundred and sixty six foot radius and dragged my tongue along a salt lick. This triggered instantaneous astral projection. My will carried my soul through space and time. I sent my soul into a mortal vessel--that of the good Doctor Dario Nardi.

It infuriated me to watch through his eyes. Dr. Nardi did not prostrate, but shook the Mittani's (pbuh) hand as if they were equal. The Mittani (pbuh), oft forgiving and ever merciful as He was, allowed this man to live.

"This is what is called Electroencephalography--EEG for short." Dr. Nardi glanced nervously at the doorway. Dabigredboat was a striking and intimidating specimen dressed in full uniform, which was perfect as the Mittani's (pbuh) royal guard.

"I'm aware of what it is," The Mittani (pbuh) replied, His perfect voice emanating from everywhere at once. "I have been following your work for years. It's fascinating how far you've come."

Dr. Nardi raised his brow. "You know about it? Here, let me show you your mind on this computer screen. I can show you any flaws, any dark corners, everything one could ever know."

The Mittani sat on the leather chair nearby the computer screens. His ass was so perfect that it caused no awkward farting noises as His pants fabric met the leather. He was perfectly postured.

"Flaws?!" Boat roared, drawing his sabre.

"That's enough, Boat," The Mittani (pbuh) ordered. "I want this. Do not deny me based upon the ignorance of a man who knows not our ways." He gestured to Dr. Nardi. "Please."

Dr. Nardi's hands trembled as Boat's piercing eyes continued to glare at him (I don't blame him; I too would cower before the war hero of Asakai), and placed the storm grey apparatus on Mittani's (pbuh) head. The Doctor's hand brushed His hair--how jealous was I!--and the computer screen lit up to show the Mind of the Mittani (pbuh).

For an instant, the Doctor saw perfection. A mind without flaws, eternal and pure, with only the motion of spinning betraying the immeasurable activity therein. In the next moment, the computers burst into flames.

"Doctor," The Mittani (pbuh) said. "This will not do. You must see for yourself what makes me perfect."

The Mittani took Dr. Nardi into his arms. One strong hand around the Doctor's waist, the other around the shoulder, cupping the back of Dr. Nardi's head.

"Do not see with mortal eyes. Here, I bestow upon you divine eyes. See that which pubbies do not, and behold that which my enemies cannot."

The Doctor stared, jaw on the floor as our Lord's divine effulgence shined brightly before him. Lest if all the stars in our sky and more rose up in union maybe they could give you a glimmer of what the Doctor saw. This was the Mittani's universal form.

The Doctor immediately folded his hands in prayers of forgiveness. "I see all the universe! He said! It's all spinning before me! I see Brahman in the Lotus flower, Zeus on Olympus, Christ prevailing over the tomb! Oh, heavens! It is all a part of you, and at the same time separate!

"Lo do I see an endless array of mouths without end, beginning or middle! Fiery and wrathful are they! It is almost impossible to see, Lord Mittani as your radiant effulgence could blind even the eyes of the divine!

"Now do I see that you are the Supreme Primal Objective, the greatest in all the worlds! Everything that is, was and shall be spirals around you my Spinmaster!"

Dr. Nardi fell backwards in awe, unable to keep his equilibrium. He looked towards the door, and saw the Fidelas Constans assassins, barbarically setting up a ballot box to vote on how to destroy the Mittani. The prophetic visions caused by the Mittani's universal form saw them riding on chariots of fire straight into the smirking mouth of the Mittani (pbuh). 

"Lord I see your enemies. They're racing into your mouths in fear of you. Scores and scores of them, wings and wheels of steel shattered like glass. Their heads are crushed between your teeth. Lord, I see the glowing radiance of your fire. It consumes all of your enemies, all of your allies, all of the asteroids and everything that is! 

"Oh Mittani, Lord of Lords, tell me who you are! I offer my obeisances unto you. Please be gracious to me. What mission do you have here? What goal does such a perfect being have for me? I sense the coming battle. I see your soldiers in the closets around the room. I see your enemies behind the door. I desire to know your mission!"

The blessed Mittani (pbuh) said:

"Time I am, destroyer of worlds. Destroyer of EVE. I have come to engage with all people. And with the exception of you and dabigredboat, all the soldiers of both sides shall be slain."

"And what shall I do?"

"Stand up and fight! After conquering all of my enemies outside, you will enjoy a Nobel Peace Prize and a Rorqual in Delve. Their killmails have already been generated by my arrangement, and you o Doctor can be but an instrument in this fight!"

The Mittani (pbuh) handed the Doctor a Rifter and a bottle of jelly and sent him with the Black Hand to the door. The Black Hand was set up with their Combat Fursuits and Carriers disguised as pigeons. The door burst open, and the fight began. Dr. Nardi squirted the bottle of jelly at the assassin (flying a Heretic). He shouted, "OW MY EYES! I'VE BEEN JAMMED!"

The Panther FCON assassin slaughtered three of the Black Hand soldiers and said. "Logistics! Vote on which injured party you shall heal first!" He was clearly the FC. He shouted at the Sin pilots, "Cast your ballots! Who shall be the next primary?!"

Some of the assassins exploded as they finished casting their ballots. Others were more experienced democrats, and had casted absentee ballots prior to combat. Still, disunity reigned. The blood of pubbie and goon flooded the halls, and Dr. Nardi surfed on a tidal wave of blood and tackled the Panther.

*All the great FCON warriors are already destroyed. Simply fight, and you will vanquish your enemies.*

The words of our Lord inspired the good doctor to fight like some of our greatest Goon warriors. He lit a cyno, and ten million Vanquishers jumped through and destroyed the entire building and all of San Diego in the far off distance.

Thus the Doctor became a hero amongst us, and has mined ever since. Even as a Nobel peace prize was bestowed upon him, he used 4G to connect to his laptop so he could mine even more. His fatbee shirt was adored by all, and he lived happily ever after.


(un) OFFICIAL RESPONSE OF THE IMPERIUM TO THE BAN OF GIGX
There has been a lot of :words: about GigX and his departure from EVE Online. A lot of them are coming from 'people' who are not Goons which means whatever sentences are formed do not matter. Allow me then to cut through the pubbie noise and give you the objective response of the Imperium on the subject of gigX and my proposed solution so we can finally all start talking about something else. Now instead of my normal religious diatribes I shall be 100% serious and 75% condescending.

Let me begin by addressing a common complaint. Read in a whiny voice: "Gigx doesn't deserve to be banned when MITTANI IN A WIZARD'S HAT AT FANFEST told a miner to kill himself and can still log in." Simply put this is a ridiculous point to push. The Mittani has more rights than GigX and normal people. The Mittani saved this game from BoB and was every member of the SEALS team that killed Osama Bin Laden. Secondly one was a threat of anger and an intent to harm and escalated by asking questions to dox Judge. Thirdly gigX did this in game where the EULA has jurisdiction whereas the Mittani was out of game. There were other measures taken due to the event so it's not like Mittens got out Scott free.

Second thing I hear is that he was a content creator and that should somehow allow him to get away with directly threatening a human being. However we should also take into consideration that he created content by locking his members out of Citadels so they can't pve and awoxing blue Supercapitals. Funny how short the memory of pubbies are but if you suckled from the lactating breasts of dabigredboat your memory would last for one thousand years like an immortal elephant.

Thirdly, we need to move on. One alliance CEO does not a lethal loss of content make. I propose we move on by naming repurposing the Keepstar as a diplomat penal coliseum. Without naming it after anyone (aside from me, name the Keepstar after me), we can honor gigX's memory by forcing our highest ranking diplomats to fight to the death in a massive free-for-all. The last man or woman standing will decide the policy of their respective alliances and will also be able to have sex with a single member of each major alliance in EVE Online of their choosing.  

We Need to Take Citadels Away From Wormholers Because they Don't Deserve It
There's nothing worse than a Wormholer (except for the ones that I like in Hole Violence and Stranger Danger). High sec pubbies are one thing, but they understand their place at the bottom of the totem pole. Wormholers are different. Every time there's a war going on they can't resist poking their head out of their hole and saying "Wow it's really noisy out here! I'm really glad I'm safe in my wormhole~~~~~~~~~!"

Let me tell you something. They don't deserve to tilde, let alone to live comfortably. CCP can't get rid of POSes without their game ceasing to function, so we should force Wormholers to bear the cross of outdated technology. Take away their Keepstars and Astrahauses, and make them sit on long sticks in their safe spaces on the moon.  That'll teach them a lesson not to look at us Nullsec-Americans so arrogantly.

A New Holiday for the Imperium
The honor of being chosen to make this announcement isn't lost on me, so let me tell you the story of the greatest moment of my entire life.

I was sprawled out over my bed as my Rorqual pilot was cherrypicking the Bistot before the Romanians did, my mattress crumbling under the weight of my body and my Warhammer 40k codexes, when my cell phone told me to kill myself. I knew the message it held was from our highest God. Sure enough, as I picked up the phone the message came from the Mittani (pbuh) who summoned me to the Vatican of Goonswarm, the Thetastar of David to make a speech to the feared and respected Goonfleet armada. The fact that the Mittani (pbuh) took time out of His day to stop intelligently retweeting every anti-Trump tweet onto his timeline and speak to me was a blessing in and of itself.

I hurried to the Thetastar, having safelogged my main in a ratting Stabber in the neighboring system. My eyes saw the most ferocious armada mankind had ever seen. There were twenty thousand Slashers, forty thousand Rorquals, (OPSEC) Titans and Supercarriers, and two hundred million Hurricane wrecks standing at attention outside of the docking bay. In place of the Fatbee, the Keepstar showed a video feed of me, the Mittani, and dabigredboat in his glorious Napoleonic era uniform (standard uniform of Bomberwaffe). I was overwhelmed. I was wearing my uniform, which was a skin tight bee cosplay. This is the paradise that Muslims only dream of. What need have I of Allah who only gives me 72 virgins when the Mittani (pbuh) provides tens of thousands of virgins from around the world? And in my last college semester studying the Qur’an there was no description of pre-nerf Rorqual mining. 

I looked to the Mittani (pbuh) and asked permission, and he allowed me to wet myself to relieve my anxiety. The crowd would have laughed, but Mittani’s (pbuh) hireling Peter Scyro didn’t hold up the sign telling the crowd they could, so they didn’t.

“Brothers and sisters of the Goonion of the Soviet Socialist Republics,” I addressed the crowd. “On behalf of the Mittani (pbuh), I have been permitted to deliver fantastic news to you all.

Peter Scyro held up a sign and the crowd cheered.

“In the dark of night, a Paladin of Justice and the beautiful woman we know as Aryth set forth a series of events that have destroyed our enemies. Aryth came down to Impass, the home of the Circle-of-Two…”

The crowd boo’d at the very mention of the name, louder as Peter held up the sign higher above his head.

“…Blessing them with a presence they did not deserve. She came to the Judge in the moonlight hour and brought to him visions of our Lord and Savior, the Mittani (pbuh). The Judge, despite being a filthy pubbie by all accounts, was at his core gay. Shown immaculate visions of our holy God’s nipples and sixteen-pack abs, the perfection of his smile and how great he looks in a red dress shirt...”

Everyone sighed dreamily as Peter raised the sign, “fawn.”

“The Judge broke down in tears, and lamented that he had followed The Beast GigX for so long. The Beast, who stabbed us all in the back and stole our fizzy-lifting drinks!”

The crowd gasped. Boat whispered a correction in my ear.

“I apologize, I meant he reset us as neutral in a crucial moment during WWB which eventually led to our tenure in Saranen and then our subsequent resettlement in Delve.”

The crowd murmered, some of them having forgotten why they hated Gigx to begin with.

“In the fury of despair, The Judge lived up to his name and deemed the Beast guilty of all the sins the Ministry of Truth told you was the objective truth. All hail the State!”

The crowd echoed, “ALL HAIL THE STATE!”

“And literally stabbed gigX in the back 666 times.”

“HAIL SATAN!”

“But The Judge only did this ironically before taking all of his sov and giving us our 12th Keepstar!”

Upon being told to, the crowd erupted into deafening cheers, orbiting each other and shooting off fireworks.

“But then GigX declared a Serbian intifada against the Judge and demanded his hands as punishment. CCP Seagull smote him from the servers, but not from Serbia. Today the Imperium thanks you, The Judge, Martyr of Impass. You who must live a life in hiding from Serbian snipers who want to take your hands. We beseech your Bosnian allies to keep you in your prayers. In your honor, we mark September 11th to be the greatest of all holidays in the Imperi—“

The MIttani slapped me in the back of my head and pointed at the asterix in the script. “Oh, sorry. September 12th will be marked as the greatest of all holidays in the Imperium. Judgment Day.

“I have also been told to announce by my corp’s immigration officer Texas Queens that we will not be accepting Serbian refugees from Impass into Wildly Inappropriate but they might be allowed to join ASCEEE as punishment for their loyalty.”

I raised my arms in the air and flapped them up and down like a bee. “ANIME IS CARTOONS!”

The crowd shrieked back, “DELVE IS GOONS!”

I shrieked back, “BZZZ BZZZ!”

And so did the crowd of adult men and women shout back, “BZZZ BZZZ!”

“IN THE NAME OF THE MITTANI, AND THE JAY, AND DABIGREDBOAT! THEY SEND THEIR REGARDS! AMEN!”


The Great Impass Safari
Little is known about the way of the pubbie to us in the Imperium. We're a civilized society, and we're blessed to be ignorant of all your savage memes and barbaric gameplay styles. However, I felt it important to make you all aware of the true nature of one pubbie so that his... followers may lament their choices and beg the Mittani (pbuh) for forgiveness. Lest, of course, you foolishly condemn yourselves to the Serbian Hunt.

This may sound crazy to you, and I would hardly believe this myself if I did not see this with my own eyes. Desperate ratters in their Vexors and their Hels ramming the docking bays of their citadels, locked to them forever. Panicking and weeping, they know their only way to safety is to the Keepstar. Hopping gate to gate, only when it's too late do they see their worst enemy: a blue Sabre yellowboxing them and fast approaching! The Hel warps to the sun on instinct, succeeding because the dictor pilot had to chase Bosnian children out of his yard.

The Hel pilot and his Vexor friend thought he was safe. That's when he saw on the horizon Circle-of-Two's most bitter enemies: gigX and his stratop fleet. Wearing a bulletproof tracksuit, a black Šubara emblazoned with a pewter CO2 insignia, and squatting on the back of a rainbow unicorn and armed with a Mizuro's Modified Broken Vodka bottle, he was already a nightmare alone. Behind him were a hundred and fifty other Serbians squatting on top of their Ruptures. It was too late for the Vexor and the Hel, as the Ruptures rammed themselves into their hulls (too drunk to anchor on their FC) and tore through their shields with artillery rounds.

This fleet to this very day is prowling Impass with the warlord gigX searching for filthy CO2 krabs. Truly truly I say unto you, it is not his intention to have CO2 become a PVP alliance. gigX *hates* CO2. Nothing is giving him more pleasure than to found the Great Impass Safari, where he hunts his own alliance members, for the fell glory of "content."

THE FIRES OF TRIUMPH; THE DEATH OF TITANS


A Man Out of Time
A panicked man is running around a maze of clocks and mirrors. He wore a monk's robe and smelled of hot sauce and was drenched in sweat. He had a trial to attend in the karmic wasteland of r/eve, and like sands through the hourglass his chances of forgiveness became more scant with every second past.

"I must go," he whispered, panicking. He ran down the corridor and fell at the end of the hall, where a clock glared down. The bell tolled on the hour, haunting and cruel.

"Oh no, there is no time!" Said the man. He sprinted desperately away from the end of the hall, eyes darting from mirror to mirror and clock to clock seeking another passageway. He jumped at the next opportunity, and stumbled up the spiral staircase. More bells started to toll in disharmonic fury as he ascended to the next floor. More clocks, more mirrors, more stairs. He was faced with his own reflection, a man deprived of justice and time.

"There is no more time! Oh no, there is no more time!"

Darting through the reflections came another. He swore he saw GigX... or had Vily come to rein in his steward? The creeping feeling of being alone... and *watched* caused this man to tremble. "I beg your forgiveness! I cannot maintain the peace between CO2 and TEST, and I cannot stop them from attacking our brethren in FCON! I can't! I can't, not because I am guilty! Not because I am evil! I just *have no time!"*

The deep rings of the bells deafened all other noises, and became one constant ringing noise in his ears, and suddenly... silence.

"You have played into my hands," came the voice of the divines. The man out of time thrusted his head left and right, but only saw his own reflection in the mirrors. Time had went on. Then, suddenly.... it was the Mittani's reflection he saw. "Progodlegend."

"You brought the agents of chaos into your midst and expected stability," the Mittani's disembodied voice continued. "And if you had the time, you may have brought peace to the South and your legacy may have even been a threat to my Imperium."

"Damn you, Mittani!" Progodlegend beat the ground with his fist after sinking to his knees. "If only I were in college, I would have skipped classes to unite these forces to destroy you!"

"Indeed. I wonder... who accelerated your graduation?"

"Y-you?! You made me graduate early?!"

"Yes," Mittani answered, his smug smile reflected in every mirror. "I changed your C's to A's, and graduated you early. I even fast-tracked your career so you could have your full-time job."

"W-w-what..."

"Yes, you could have been an existential threat to me. But you don't have any time."

The Mittani appeared before Progodlegend in all his divine glory. PGL shrieked out a desperate warcry and charged the Spinmaster Supreme. 

"Where as I have all the time in..." the Mittani teleported behind Progodlegend. The hands on all the clocks have stopped, and were in pause for five seconds. "The World."

The Mittani kicked Progodlegend through a mirror, and screaming did he fall into a world of clocks that swirled around him. An infernal orange glow lit the ground below him. It was a sea of spicy chicken wings of justice. Progodlegend screamed even louder until he fell into the burning ocean of chicken and alliance politics.

Busted at the Alliance Tournament
I was rolling around the Alliance Tournament on my Pride Maxima Heavy-Duty 3-Wheel Scooter, watching the massacre of Pandemic Legion by the Initiative. I remember that battle clearly. As his Oneiros was obliterated, fin1712 fell off out of his chair in a massive seizure. "I'M NOT OWNED, **I'M NOT OWNED!!!!" I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ELIIIIIIIIITE!!!!"** he screamed, but it was too late. Just as a tribal prophet from distant lands predicted, his bones broke and bent and in a flash of light and blood he transformed into a corn cob. His enemies took the initiative and slaughtered Pandemic Legion. That is not the tale I wish to tell you though.

I am undercover here. Not just for the Mittani (I am a triple agent, spying on the Imperium for the Imperium), but for CCP Games. I am officially hired to watch the floors of the Alliance Tournament for illegal gambling. Even if it's a thumb war, I'll smash your hands with my 96" E-Z Reacher. I don't play around.

Around the bend I heard a commotion. I saw [Boris Agnon](https://zkillboard.com/character/2112609750/) flipping a coin and wearing a leather jacket while listening to jazz music. Clearly a troublemaker, even with the Karmafleet tag. He couldn't be a REAL Goon if what I suspected was true.

"hey," I greeted with my shrill falsetto voice, "do you have stairs in your house?"

"Yeah I have stairs in my house," the disguised pubbie replied. Got him.

"so i want to bet on the alliance tournament with you," I offered.

"Sure, three vehements on the fact Brave will lose."

"GOTCHA! SEAGULL!"

The ceiling above us shattered, sending concrete and asbestos raining down on the fleeing profligates and degenerates. Boris looked up in horror at a woman with short hair wearing a pink Power Rangers outfit. She had large wings, white and feathered. It was the famous angel of androgyny, the warrior queen of Iceland, the corporate colossus of video games, CCP Seagull.

"he was gambling," I said, pointing to the fake Goon.

"No," Boris wept. "It can't be! I thought I could get away with it!"

Silent, CCP Seagull summoned a pack of velociraptors she purchased with all the credit card money I used on plex and skill injectors, and out of her power ranger pockets she revealed Boris' PC.

In horror, Boris watched as CCP Seagull threw his PC into the pack of velociraptors which sexually assaulted his water coolers and eviscerated his hard drive and video card. As he was distracted, I pulled myself out of my scooter and fell on top of Boris, killing him instantly.

Being an anti-gambling Inquisitor is hard work and it doesn't pay any money or ISK, but it's a job and someone's gotta do it.

The Pandemic Virgin vs the Chad Initiative.


LEAKED STATE OF THE GOONION: The Imperium Marches on its Greatest Enemy
Citizens of the Imperium. Our finest hour is at hand, and we are to march on our most hated enemies. For almost a decade, these traitors have constantly sabotaged our efforts. Their interdictors bubble our fleets at the most critical moments, their psychological warfare interrupts the words and even thoughts of our esteemed fleet commanders. They cause dissent, drama, and discord throughout our lands. They have been our mortal enemies since our very founding.

The Goonswarm Federation and the members of the Imperium officially declare war against the Imperium and the Goonswarm Federation. Make no mistake, we shall not leave a single excavator in the collosal that dot our beloved Delve. These sinister Goons and their pets have mined and ratted the EVE economy to Hell, and the Mittani has seen fit to end their reign of terror on Imperium lands once and for all.

We call upon our valued allies to come together, from Stainwagon to Red Alliance, to exterminate these wretched Bees from Fortress Delve and bring harmony back to our beloved empire once more. Thank you.

Test Prophecy Please Ignore
As much as I would like to talk to you about the glories of the Imperium, I must share a prophetic vision I had received last night. This is in regards to TEST Alliance Please Ignore and its recent attack on DARKNESS. If you wish not to believe me, so be it. But listen to what I have to say.

It was three o'clock in the morning and I had spent the past twelve hours in the corner booth of the local Taco Bell gorging myself on sixty nine XXL Grilled Stuft Burritos which I dip in Diet Coke prior to starting. I was covered in sweat and grease, and the table was covered in zero-calorie beverages and the oil of several dead cows whose very lives were dedicated towards feeding me.

For these twelve hours I didn't think or register anyone around me. Apparently someone tried to stop me around the twenty-second burrito and I ate half of their hand on instinct. I feel a rumbling in my stomach as if the ghosts of all the farm animals I had consumed had decided to kick my intestines. I realize it is time to shit, but I can't escape from the booth. I shake violently, trying to seep the oil onto my man-breasts so I can squeeze out of my booth. However, it is to no avail. My heart pounds like the drums of war, and my vision fades into mist as a noxious smell overcomes Taco Bell.

The haze lifts. I am standing on a shattered Fortizar in Perrigen Falls. The sky is a tapestry of darkness adorned with an astonishing number of stars. I shiver, not because this universe is as cold as it is unforgiving, and I was alone in it.

My head turns, and I was released from that chilling serenity by the savagery of war. The stars and I bore witness to Avatars banishing a fleet of Rokhs to oblivion with a blinding flash of light and fire, a squad of interceptors flew overhead to seek the destruction of a Wyvern caught by itself, its explosion casting me off of my feet into one of the many spires on the Fortizar.

The ground shook beneath me, and I must admit I trembled in fear as I rose to see the two mightiest warriors of their respective armies. Standing above the fray was a physical testament to power and wrath, a Tyrannosaurus Rex. He bore a red tie, and his eyes burned with hate and wrath as he stared down his foe. His enemy bore wings twice the size of the body bearing them, and the gold gathered from a successful GoFundMe campaign were stuck between the violet iridescent scales of a fire-breathing dragon.

The Tyrannosaurus lunged forward, its massive mouth opening up as a cavern of teeth, seeking to bite the neck of the dragon. The winged beast reeled back quickly, and its tail struck the Tyrannosaurus which grunted in pain. Tornadoes and Typhoons flew between these awesome creatures as they fought, and the ground quaked as if a fault line shuddered beneath my feat. Soon this purple dragon's wing was stepped on by the massive foot of the Tyrannosaur. The dragon screamed in pain, and a geyser of flame set forth from his mouth to turn its enemy to ash. But the Tyrant King was not made of flesh and bone, but of memes and thermal hardeners.

The Tyrannosaurus Rex's maw closed on the neck of the dragon, and even in space I could hear the heart-stopping shattering of bone and blood-curdling shrieks of the purple dragon piercing my ears until it slowly faded. I turned my head to the south, and I felt relieved; I could still hear the faint buzzing. My people were safe in Fortress Delve. Not even the Middle Management Dino could shatter our kingdom, but as this world passed from my mind and the fiery eyes of the blood-mouthed Tyrannosaurus faded into black, I knew the North would fall to TEST. EVE is real, and dragons are not.

I woke up in an ambulance that was being towed because its wheels collapsed under my weight.

Imperium Victory over /u/Sara_Naud Uprising
It was a gorgeous day in Delve, just like all the other ones. Not a single wormhole in sight, and I spent the last thirty eight hours listening to the heavenly hum of my excavators carving away at a spodumain asteroid made sixty times the size of my ship. Paradise in the Imperium. 

Happiness on this day was not meant to last. I sensed a disturbance in my mind which caused me to stand up and scream at the top of my lungs for a solid five minutes. I scrambled to the front page of /r/eve and saw [THIS.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6qgc51/my_fellow_goons_this_saddens_me_to_say/)

My eyes rolled back and I started twitching and writhing on the floor and my vision faded into a bloody crimson veil. A civil war in the Imperium... no... a traitorous insurrection. Who was the usurper? Who would dare challenge the uncontested divinity of the Mittani over the very heart of the Goonswarm Federation? A few names darted through my minds like whizzing bullets. I saw the name.

"Who the fuck is /u/Sara_Naud," I ask myself. But I was informed by Kendarr, the great general of the Imperium who was assigned to be in my room after the lamp incident. I instinctually loaded antimatter in his presence even though I was piloting a Rorqual and gave me the mission: to destroy /u/Sara_Naud and bring this rebellion to an end before he threatens the Mittani’s multi-dollar media empire.

I drew my katana and donned my Naruto headband and ate an extra tendie for good luck. I would not let this monster threaten the Mittani’s future yacht by defunding His IRL corp wallet. I knew how that felt when my mother told me I could only buy one figure of Fluttershy. Austerity would not reign terror on my Prophet.

I found the traitor in a Wawa’s in the Philadelphia area as he was punching in his order for a chicken sandwich. He didn’t even have the bun toasted.

I called towards him when the automatic doors closed, and Sara’s eyes widened in terror as he saw me approach. My fatbee t-shirt I hadn’t taken off for six weeks did not cover my midriff, and my bath towel covered up my groin and the fact I had not yet bought a kimono.

I teleport behind him. “The Mittani sends his regards.” I swung my katana, the same one used to cut SirMolle’s Ethernet chord during the Great EVE War. The katana caught the glow off the incandescent light bulbs and a blinding flash shone through the room. Sara fell to the floor, and his body exploded. He was a robot.

I pulled his head from the wreckage. “Who were you really, Sara Naud?!” I scream at the charred android skull I hold in my hands. Red and blue lights shone through the windows of the store, but no authority goes beyond the Mittani so I know I’m safe. “Reveal yourself to me! Is it you, DARIUS Johnson?!”
The audio whirred and clicked, and through the crackle and white noise I hear the words, *I am Xenuria* fade in and out. This was a level of autism I could not confront on my own. I reported this to the Black Hand, and was imprisoned anyways because I accidentally left adblock on while browsing Imperium News. We had won the battle, my friends. The war however, is just beginning.


How Many Apocalypses Need to Die Before the Sotiyo is Satisfied


VIOLENCE GUARANTEES CITIZENSHIP (Now Available to Own on DVD and VHS)


I Was Accused of being a TEST Spy
I was sitting in comms just kinda talking to everyone. I thought it was going to be a normal day in Space Violence. I was wrong.

Kendarr asked me about my day, and I told him that I had a good day. For my birthday my mom got me a lamp and a denim jacket. This is where I made my mistake. A fatal mistake.

I informed him the lamp was in the shape of a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

Mumble went silent. I didn't realize my error until my door went crashing down, and I was forced to the ground by a pair of middle-aged men dressed as German Shepherds. The Black Hand! They were very well trained, not tearing me apart but holding me down with their bite force.

I peered into the doorway, struggling to lean up to meet my attacker. Squeezing through the passage was a man of overwhelming size and power dressed as Napoleon Bonaparte, flanked on the bicorne hat by a squeaky bee. DaBigRedBoat had come to take me away!

"No, Commissar! I would never betray the Imperium!" I said. "Hark, for I wear the colors of our great nation!" I gestured towards my breast that bore the Fatbee my mother so detested.

"Tell it to the God Emperor," he said, raising the butt of his rifle and smashing it into my forehead.

I woke up chained to a dirt floor in an arena. I could stand, but the chains linked to my arms so I could not strike or flee. The sole light in this arena shone only on me, and I looked desperately into the darkness for help.

"AM I NOT A GOON?!" I cried out in despair. "AM I NOT A GOON AND A BROTHER?"

For an hour, the only answer to my lament was the return of silence. Neither wind nor weather came to fill my ears with idle noise. As time went on, the spotlight faded and I was engulfed in void.

My eyes were burned as a light more brilliant than the breaking dawn shone from the doorway. Standing before me, shirtless and rippling with muscle, wearing leather pants was none other than our God the Mittani. 

His radiant glow revealed that I was not alone, but all my great leaders had silently watched me, flanked by the Black Hand agents who sat faithfully beside their masters on a leash. Boat, Jay, Laztel, Asher, and Kendarr glared at me. I knew this could be the end.

The Mittani’s voice echoed through the halls, and no matter where He stood it was as if I heard Him from every direction. “I heard that you…” He paused, folding his arms. “Bought a lamp bearing the sigil of our enemy.”

“I would never,” I pled, “If you would but laid eyes on my lantern thou wouldst see Mittani, see that it is a green dinosaur and not tan or grey! Nor does it bear the tie of the normie!”

The Mittani smashed His leg into my stomach, and I crumbled to the ground. “How dare you deign to order me, the Mittani, to seek out ‘evidence’ of your innocence!”

I staggered to my feet, but the Mittani teleported behind me and smacked my ass with a stop sign until I lay flat on the ground. “I can see through your pitiful lies. You are an agent sent by Progodlegend. An agent sent to steal information about our invasion of the North.”

“I would never give a shred of truth to the outsider!” I blurted out, and found myself in horror as I realized I spoke out of turn.

The Mittani snapped His finger, and the leaders of the Imperium released the Black Hand from their leashes and those men in German Shepherd fursuits ran on all fours and started to maul me.

“The fact you have an ounce of resistance in your heart proves to me that you’re nothing but a spy,” the Mittani concluded. His eyes started to glow red just like His veins, and He held up a large hammer of incredible size that no one but this sixteen-pack shirtless bishounen God could wield. It was the banhammer. The Black Hand fled in terror. I was going to be Commissared!
As the Mittani made the first motion to swing his mighty weapon and end my life, he stopped almost frozen in time.

The Mittani dropped the hammer above my head, and His mighty gaze noticed my bulge. He gave a cat-like smile. “Ho? What’s this?” Then He kicked me in the balls, and I wept in pain and despair.


“Are you not going to kill the spy?” Boat asked incredulously. He shrunk back as the Mittani’s powerful gaze met him eye-to-eye.

“No, he is not a spy,” The Mittani concluded, turning His back on me. “Only the most loyal of my men’s erections could stand firm during my interrogation. Free him. Send him back to Mumble and Delve.”

And that is my story of how I was first accused of being a spy and lived.


I BESEECH THEE GREAT MITTANI (pbuh), DO NOT FORGET ME IN YOUR PRAYERS


[SUMMER OF RAGE] WE CAN'T LET CCP GET AWAY WITH THIS
We the community of EVE Online have plenty of grievances against CCP Games. However, none of of you truly *get it.* Police skins, Ghost training, Citadel Timers? Fucking Fozziesov? These are all false flag operations to distract you from the real crime: CCP Games is perpetuating the globalist lie that the Earth is not flat.

You can fly around New Eden and see this disgusting defamation of the truth in every system. Instead of seeing Jita as a flat disc or riding on the back of a giant sea turtle, you see her portrayed as a fucking ball. CCP, how is the ISK not just falling out of the bottom of Jita?

Look, you may *think* I'm crazy, but I had to quit this game for a while because I was on a mission to bring sanity back into EVE Online. I originally thought CCP was ignorant and brainwashed like the rest of society. My goal was to write a 6,000 page treatise on why the Earth was flat and thus all other planetary bodies needed to be portrayed as such and present it personally to the angel of androgyny herself, CCP Seagull.

I took a flight to Reykjavik on United Airlines a couple months back. You could see how They wanted to keep the flatness of our world a secret because I was detained for 48 hours the first time because they detected my Bosch GPL3-RT 3-Point Self-Leveling Alignment Laser wrapped up in my Keffiyeh when I went through the metal detector. They eventually let me go when they realized they couldn't put me up for a circus trial for "possible terrorism" because I would speak the truth to the whole world.

After two days I made it on board and I was flying on a mostly empty plane towards Reykjavik. The plan was simple: Use the laser leveler to show that there was no curviture of the Earth otherwise the plane would have to compensate. Afterwards, I would write all six thousand pages prior to landing and reveal my findings to CCP Games and begin the Flat Earth Revolution. This would revive Gamergate and shatter the globalist machine's grip on the real world.

I untucked my leveler from my Keffiyeh and set it on the arm rest. Perfectly level. There was this really nice Arabian man right next to me who seemed just as excited as I was. He leaned in and whispered into my ear, "Soon brother, inshallah." I nodded. This was going to be a great moment in history.

I watched for seven hours straight and there was not a single change once we were securely in the air. I felt vindicated, especially since I video taped all seven hours on my Android smartphone the stewardess told me to put away.

I got up, nearly two hours away from Reykjavik because I needed to pee. I stopped in the middle of the aisle, sensing a dark presence. I felt a tug at my pant leg, and I thought it was a child. It was no child. It was CCP Guard.

The jig was up. I started bolting down the aisle but CCP Guard caught up with me and performed a hurricanrana that threw me out of coach and into first class. I saw that wild hatred in his eyes, that knowing malice. CCP Games wasn't ignorant of the Flat Earth. IT IS AN ACTIVE SUPPRESSOR OF THE TRUTH. I remembered my training I constantly re-enacted from my Naruto manga, and I tied my Hidden Leaf Village Headband around my head to honor my master. I met CCP Guard in one on one combat.

It was a devastating defeat. He had me on the ground, and all my access points were cut off by Guard's sleeper agents in the attendants staff. The passengers merely assumed that the flight was overbooked and I needed to be thrown off the plane. He dragged me to the restroom and told me these words: "I will not let you expose this secret. I will destroy these tapes. I will pay you well to keep quiet. Here is five hundred dollars."

I'll tell you what I did. I took that money. But jokes on you, CCP Guard. I spent all five hundred dollars on PLEX in EVE Online, skill injected a supercarrier and I make 260 million ISK ticks and RMTed it to fund the Flat Earth Society. We need to fight CCP Games, ladies and gentlemen. Not on red herrings like game mechanics, but for the future so we can see our planets on turtles from Branch all the way down to Feythabolis. Let's start this Summer of Rage right. Let's fight for a Flat Earth.

We Space Communism Now

Is EVE Dying?
Once I thought EVE was dying. I remember when I asked the doctors that question. I was standing at her bedside as she was reeling in and out of consciousness from all the chemotherapy from World War Bee. The cancer was killing her. Doctors weren’t sure where the cancer started. Some theorized that the cancer began when TEST kept posting memes of manchildren in dinosaur costumes on the EVE subreddit. Two other doctors were screaming at each other about some infection known as a Svipul and the terminal “missile mechanic” illness. The nurses were defecating their own scrubs while rolling on the floor screaming about how James 315 was ruining EVE’s experience in life and caused the cancer to metastasize. 

I hugged my darling EVE, and promised her that I would see her soon.

The smell of feces and medical science all fell away as a bright light shone from the ceiling. I thought it was the incandescent lights, but truly it was a miracle all its own.

I thought my eyes deceived by some spell, but verily did I see an angel descend above our bed. Her hair was as soft and brown as dry soil and her eyes shined like the stars. It was CCP Seagull!
As she descended from the heavens, the Angel of Androgyny lifted her gown with graceful fingers and started farting all over EVE Online. Her farts smelled of mead and a dusty graphics card. To the amazement of my ears I heard the heavenly hymn of Below the Asteroids.

She whispered into EVE’s ear, “alpha clones and a burning mineral market lmao”

Suddenly, my darling’s hair started to grow back into a beautiful afro, and her skin changed from chalky white to a delicious chocolate, for EVE is Minmatar and EVE is real. She smiled for the very first time and said, “happy christmas eve baby”

We made love right there on the hospital bed amidst the putrid smell of the still-screaming nurses and the watchful eyes of CCP Seagull with her video camera. So if anyone asks if EVE is dying, tell them no. EVE is alive, wetter and tighter with every thrust and better than ever


Why they hate the Code: The Common Bot Aspirant


Need a new PC, what's best for EVE?
Earlier this morning I was flying around on my new alpha clone Artydragon in a Thrasher. This was the first time I was doing solo PVP on an alpha clone, so I had at least half of an erection as I jumped into the small plex with my opponent. Allegedly due to my lack of skill training and according to local chat, "talent," I died in like three hits.

As my pod warped off to a station, I felt a rage well up inside of me. It was as if my heart was a stormy ocean, its salty water smashing the galleons in its way. I rose from my beanbag chair, which stuck to my tooshie (I've sat in it for the past three days). The ground shook with each step I took, and my arms reached for my PC in wrath.

I started punching the casing with all of my might. Sparks started to fly as my meaty hands stained with pizza oil smashed into the casing. I then hugged the crumbled mass of metal and plastic to suffocate it. My monitor turned off, likely due to fright.

It was then I dislocated my jaw, and slowly swallowed my computer over the course of nine hours. It was a difficult task (ATI graphics cards are not very sweet), but I pushed every speck of metal, plastic, and fiber down my throat and into my stomach. I fell asleep.

My budget is around 1.5k and I wish to run about five accounts or more at once on max graphics so I can gank in high security space. What's a really good rig for EVE Online? Also Overwatch.

Happy Valentines Day to CCP
Today is the day that love is in the air and sales of exotic dancers skyrockets, and we all let our loved ones and total strangers know how much you love them. As you all know, CCP Staff frequent Reddit far more than they do the EVE Online forums because let's be real honest, even they don't want to be there.

So this is the perfect place to make them feel as loved and/or uncomfortable as possible. Everyone here should write a sappy love letter to our favorite CCP member. Remember: if it makes you cringe, add more purple prose. Pour out your soul. Show up at their house.



I am Running For CSM 11
Today I announce my candidacy for CSM 11. Shh. Don't speak. I am omniscient. I know exactly what you're thinking. "Naz, you gorgeous well-hung stallion of a man. This election is for CSM 12!"

Don't worry, progodlegend. I know exactly what CSM election is being held right now. I mean precisely what I say. I am running for CSM 11. I am going back in time to defeat MrHyde and save EVE Online from this tyrant taking the seat of power.

I concocted this plan after I started watching Steins;Gate and heard about John Titor, the time traveling man whose story frankly confused me. I uncovered the blueprints to his time traveling machine and I built it with great effort. I even had to sell two anime figures, including the Hirasawa Yui figure from K-On!!. 

Look guys. 2015 was a rough year. I wasn't around for it, but holy shit it must be if you were turning to a guy who hates spicy memes. Unlike my opponent MrHyde, I *will* make battleships great again. Now I don't need all this balancing knowledge. I'm going to remove every ship class below battleship. Every newbie will start out in a Megathron, even if they aren't Gallente. Everyone deserves to get in on that Baltecfleet! I'm also going to make every slave NPC freeable, and upon being free they will become an exotic dancer (gender of their choosing).

And unlike MrHyde, I will run again for CSM12 with my good buddy I've never actually talked to: Rhiload. We're going to make memes spicier than a Jalapeno pepper that does in-game thermal damage.

Naz al-Ghul for CSM11: We want DICKS!

Why do miners hate CCP programmers?
Because they made EVE Online operate on billions of lines of...

*CODE.*

is it rmt if it's Chinese food?
Guys I don't know how to react to this, mainly because this hit so close to home.

I was sitting in Mumble, talking to my corpmates in Wildly Inappropriate where I am surrounded by some of the nicest blue-blooded Americans you could ever hope to meet. This corpmate who shall remain anonymous has always been a paragon of virtue. I've never entered a conversation where he wasn't the moral keystone, even on sensitive topics such as race and politics. He is beloved by all, and I consider him the greatest friend God could grant my life.

You can see why my heart shattered into pieces on that fateful Wednesday evening when I got home from work. He came out of an alleyway wearing nothing but a trenchcoat and cornered me. Nothing too suspicious so far. But then he asked me, “Hey kid. I need some Chinese food. If you give me Chinese food I’ll give you a billion ISK.”

I got to tell you, I froze. Then I ran. I ran as fast as I could, deliberately pushing people into oncoming traffic so I could continue running. I ran all the way to the police department to ask them the question I am going to pose you. These stalwart defenders of justice are a farce. They asked me stupid questions such as “what is isk” and “what is a goonswarm?” Pfft. Probably a part of the EVE Facebook group. I was thrown out without a solid answer.

This is my moral dilemma. Is it RMT if it’s Chinese food? How can I, Naz al-Ghul, justify a billion ISK if General Tso is allowed to rape the EVE Gate? I don’t want to be like IWI or Zarvox Torval. I want to do the right thing. Help me, guys. I am very confused.


THE VIRGIN SACRIFICES HAVE BORE FRUIT. IMPERIUM SMASHES DV CAPS


Why did the Imperium lose so many dreadnoughts?
You troglodytes. You sycophants. You traitors. You who don't even spin your ships, how can you even speak to us about the death of our dreadnoughts? You just don't understand our glorious, evil plan.

We knew this war would be tough on our people. The Imperium became soft and fat with the excess of ISK and Klondike Bars permeating Delve and my freezer. We weren't worried about CO2 and FCON so much, but TEST was another matter. I remember sitting in on several higher up meetings. We were not keen on fighting an alliance of over seven thousand sentient tyrannosauruses, and many times Asher would break down weeping during his Yu-Gi-Oh sessions against Jay (Jay would let him win so Asher could feel good about his Exodia deck). The Mittani in his vast wisdom understood there was only one thing that could guarantee a total victory against TEST.

In the ancient days of the Aztecs when war approached, the priests of their Gods would gather a virgin from the village and sacrifice them on an altar.

Do you see what has happened? Don't you realize that every single capital pilot in this game has to be some kind of megavirgin? Who else would ever want to pilot anything other than a Svipul? Didn't your spies hear our great leader the Mittani chant in tongues over Mumble while smacking a tamborine? Perhaps it was because you're all MUGGLES. Perhaps you don't have your settings right in Mumble. You really need to check that.

The flat surfaces of the fortizars you tried to online served as an excellent altar. With every Vertical Supremacist you made horizontal, you sent another soul to Bob. You fools. You've guaranteed our victory. You could have a billion tyrannosauruses lined against us, and they will crumble against our fury. The Gods are with us TEST, and *the asteroid is coming.*

Imperium and TESCO blue each other to assault CCP Servers
Battle report being generated as we speak. Cracks seemed to be forming on CCP's server nodes but ultimately are holding out against the onslaught.

CRACKS FORMING, TEST FLANKS BROKEN, CO2 REDUCED, FCON FUCKED, ASTRAHUS SMASHED BY THE IMPERIUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUM


RISE, IMPERIUM
The sun has set on peace, and tonight we prepare for war. We fight against TEST Alliance, Circle-of-Two, and FCON. Three alliances may not seem like a great deal, but each alliance is made up of corporations, housing a great deal of people. TEST, an enemy by their own choice, has 54 member corporations, and 7766 members. What more, Fidelas Constans and Circle-of-Two, a band of backstabbing traitors have between them 133 member corps and 7340 people. We face an army of 15,106 traitors and rabble-rousers, who want nothing more than to break down the doors of our neighbors and leave us wide open to attack!

You see the propaganda on the front page. They want to make us feel small. They want to make you feel like all the stars are our enemies. They did this in the North, where their endless ISK from the shady bankers funded our eviction, and they're doing this now. I think in their revelry they have forgotten that from the very beginning, we're an alliance and a coalition that called forth everyone from New Eden to be a part of something big, even if they were small. They forget that despite the banging of their pots and pans and catchy slogans, we are so successful and so welcoming, that we have grown beyond 20,000 people as a coalition.

All the stars are our enemy, but we outnumber the stars.

THE DAWN WILL RISE AND SEE THE BATTLEFIELD. RISE, IMPERIUM. LET'S KICK SOME ASS.

CCP Games took our DICKS away and we want them back!
This company has given us the shaft for the last time! The Defender Integrated Counter-Kill System was a great name and basically encapsulated everything there was about this module! Now it's just "Defender Missile." You've castrated all meaning from its title. What was your reason, CCP? You couldn't find a way to translate the name into Russian? It's never stopped you before!

I propose we all go on strike, and chant at the top of our lungs: WE WANT DICKS! WE WANT DICKS! WE WANT DICKS! SAY IT WITH ME

A friend of mine had shot at the Keepstar and didn't get on the killmail. CCPLS
Yerglim Aldent is a corpmate of mine. I'm not entirely sure if the Imperium sent any fleets to the moe system or if he just went up on his own, but he went through all the trouble of going through TiDi and stuff, and when the killmail was produced?

His name was not on that sacred killmail. For a while I had to hear the sulking and the moaning, and vague threats of going back to World of Warcraft.

CCPls, make sure you keep him off that killmail. Just make sure his name is not on there. It'll be far more hilarious that way. Thank you for your time.

Mission Runner newbie, asking about Guristas Epic Arc

Wormholers: Tell us a Thanksgiving story!
Hello, r/eve. I am Naz al-Ghul, and as an American Citizen, I celebrate Thanksgiving. For the Euros, Thanksgiving is a time where we come together and celebrate our bloody and merciless conquest of the indigenous people who originally helped feed us and taught us to be self-sufficient in a brave new world. Instead of giving a shit, I thought about spaceships online.

Wormhole life is basically a game of cowboys and Indians, so! Wormholers. What's your favorite eviction story?

I think my Mom is in Pandemic Legion
I know what you're thinking. "This is retarded and I don't care." But please, hear me out. I don't have much time.

It all started a few weeks back when I bought my Fatbee coffee mug. As you all know (because as an attention whore I posted a picture of it here), it was beautiful. Fatbee was holding a mug with Fatbee on it, the cup held my coffee, and I could drink it while watching my VNI orbit around an F-Hub. My mom never liked the mug, which is dumb. Who doesn't love Fatbee? She said some day it would disappear because it was "ugly." I chuckled nervously, tentatively interpreting her insidious smile as a comical grin. However, the seeds of suspicion were laid that my own mother had become a PL agent.

My suspicions blossomed into mighty sunflowers as she contracted laryngitis.

Laryngitis is a viral infection. The Pandemic Legion logo is a virus. Coincidence?

As paranoia washed over me like the cleansing waters of my weekly shower, I tried to calm down. Gnawing on my frozen Smuckers, I dug deeper into my journals. I'm not some amateur about to fall for a CO2 false flag. I'm Naz al-Ghul motherfucker, and I'm a professional Goon. I spin my ship five times a day as my prophet demands, and my faith preserved me as I discovered more things about this dark world my family had been plunged into.

I live in the northern US, and Pandemic Legion owns the North. On the front of the one dollar bill (people who look at the back are fucking stupid), George Washington sits solemnly. George Washington died of an inflammation of the throat. My mother's throat is also inflammed. Let's not forget, the dollar is made of money which was used by Lenny Kravitz2 to fund World War Bee and drive us out of the North.

As the pieces came together like a puzzle, I fell out of my bean bag chair in shock. My own mother had betrayed me to PL. It made sense now. Every time I was about to go on an op, she'd "call me down to dinner" or "wanted to talk to me about how my day was." I see through your spy Grath Talkin. What did you offer her? To pay off her car? Officer modules? How dare you. I will fight you to my dying breath sir. You have not seen the last of Naz al-Ghul.

You need to fix one thing, CCP.
Steam is not "free to play." This is gonna cause some confusion, which is bad on the day your game's gonna get the most attention.

Minmatar vs Gallente Alpha clones
I was reading about all the Alpha clone changes, and in the meantime I've been more inclined to trust the rust and not hate the Minmatar faction. I want to create an alt solely dedicated to hisec ganking, and I am unsure if I should go thrasher or catalyst for the best results, so I guess I'll have to choose between Minmatar and Gallente. Which of these factions will farm the most salt?

Alarm goes off. Wake up. Time to spin some ships.


Make the DDoS stop, I want to undock from real life
There's only one sun in real life and it's too bright for my eyes. I am eternally warp scrambled and I feel vulnerable outside of my pod.

Say one good thing about an alliance you hate
We in New Eden say a lot of mean and hurtful things to each other because of our alliance affiliation. Some would say "If you ever stopped masturbating to your alliance-wide unwarranted hubris and undocked you might still have the North," just because I am goon. Someone might say "If you climbed down from your pile of extra chromosomes you might not have lost so many goddamn Titans" purely because someone's in CO2. Today, I call an end to this negativity. Today we will say one nice thing about an enemy alliance that we hate the most. I don't hate alliances, so I'll choose The-Culture.

Your logo is probably the coolest one ever. Stay alive forever or give me rights to it cuz that's some neuromancer shit yo.

PSA to all of my fellow shitposters!

Change for blood Raider ships
To promote blood donations throughout the event, Aura should say "Blood Drive Active" when you warp in a Blood Raider ship.

Anyone experiencing a major framerate drop as of this patch?
Title. My computer's no prize but it could run EVE above fifty FPS most of the time. Now it's hitting around 30FPS outside of stations, and a cringey 17 inside my citadel.

hey horde
You good, buddy?

Let's fix wormholes!
Every wormhole should be changed to CCP Guard's face with his mouth open, and when you jump in he eats your ship and poops you out on the other side.

Captain's Quarters in citadels
I want to be able to sit on a couch in Anoikis, but all I get is to take control of a death machine. I need to relax too, CCP. What gives?

CCP Games celebrates the birth of Christ a day early
On Christmas EVE 


Don't worry, I'll see myself out.

How many CCP staff members does it take to screw in a light bulb?
None, because the socket's closed!

The In-Game Browser and the future of EVE Apps
I remember the in-game browser was never a high-quality addon in the game. Granted, it was just a basic browser and it wasn't meant to be something special, but there is a bit of a problem nowadays. While nobody really used it for web-browsing per-se, people seem to use it quite a bit for unique applications in EVE Online. Pathfinder comes to mind most recently as I fiddle around with wormsec, and there are plenty of other alliance-specific functions that only work on the IGB.

Is this the end of an era for these programs, or will there always be hidden option to open the IGB?

An Open Letter to CCP
Thanks for the game. I started out not understanding anything about what people were talking about and thought it was all some cool lingo but as I got sucked into your black hole I realize I am in a science fiction baboon cage populated by 17-35 thousand angry monkeys throwing poop at each other. Now I am also a monkey throwing poop.

Have a good day.

What ridiculous add-on do you want for your favorite ship?
Ever wish your favorite ship could do something obviously broken but definitely fun? Personally I want the Phantasm to get a utility slot and to be able to fit a covert ops cloaking device. 

A question about Serpentis SKINs
Is it just me or do these skins not actually exist within the game? I'm looking at the market because the Serpentis Skins are the jazziest skins ever, however there's nothing for sale at all. Are they available through ratting or are they really absent from EVE itself?

EVE is not dying, so you know what to do
We need to kill it. Free ourselves from the shackles around our brains! We have been trapped far too long by MEMES IN SPACE. Riot outside of Jove Space! Storm the EVE Gate! RIIIIIOOOOOT

wormholes?
I know hole squad on that real shit, but does Karmafleet have any access to gsf wormholes?

Mercenary Coalition moving through Faurent


A cheap version of a Daredevil?
Hey guys, my favored style of gameplay aside from losing expensive ships is flying something that can hold someone down so they can't move and punch them in the face until they can't live anymore. I like the Daredevil in theory because it does those things, but it's kind of expensive to order en masse. The Dramiel has the Republic Fleet Firetail as it's poor man's version. Does the Daredevil?

Any word on CCP's official opinion on the Svipul?
I haven't flown or fallen victim to the ship yet, nor do I generally care to fly it. What makes the Svipul superior to the other T3Ds? And has CCP said anything concerning its power at all? Not to diss them, I'm just wondering from what direction they're approaching game balance.

Riot Games, like em or not, has a particular direction they take when balancing their game. They want to destroy percieved  over-complexity by tackling the issue of "burden of knowledge" and make the game faster and more aggressive. Is there a solid direction CCP takes?

And how would YOU balance the Svipul? 

Who is Xenuria?
I've heard he's got some kind of reputation. Is he an e-celeb or something? If so, what's he famous for?

It is my BIRTHDAY!
As the title suggests, it is my birthday! I've got several wishes (a Stratios and a date with Emma Watson) but I'd rather you tell me the story your absolute favorite kill in EVE Online pvp! Tell me about how you murdered people in space.

By God! It's full of loot! (eventually, 80m worth of it!)


It IS full of stars! And eventually, 80mill worth of loot!


Wormhole Life
I'm pretty sure I understand the three main areas to live in as one makes a home in New Eden. High-sec is made up of a bunch of Ferengi and new people, low-sec is made up of people who fight over control over different systems but without a shitty sov system, and null-sec is empty save for the areas where it totally fucking isn't holy shit there are 600 people in local and none of them are blue.

Can someone tell me about Wormhole life though? Profitability is a factor in my inquisitiveness, but really my question is what's it like living in a wormhole day-to-day? How do you stand it? If you're a hole-dweller, what's your favorite thing to do in wormholes? And what are the top-rated WH corps in the game? I'm not aware of any aside from Hole Violence and Hole Control.

Can I sue CONCORD?
I may have an extensive criminal record and am actively trying to nosedive my sec status to -10, and I may have killed like thirty hundred people but I am a human being and I have rights. The police can only attack people if they're breaking a law. How dare you declare me guilty before I have my fair trial. This is police brutality. You can't just assume guilt like I'm some Brutor! Disarm CONCORD!

I was trying to dock up really quickly and this popped up! Haha


PC rig advice for someone who wants to be in a gigantic battle
Hello, /r/eve. I'm shitposter #3962. I have a question.

I have a decent computer that runs EVE on mixed settings at 60fps, and I've noticed that when I did partake in a battle with a good deal of people in it (we killed a Paladin, that was fun but I don't know why anyone would fly a Marauder in fleet PVP), the game began to lag and crap out on me.

I get that CCP has countermeasures for this, but I was wondering what I should upgrade on my computer so that a consistently good FPS can be held even during a mass battle?

I'm not very good with computers and I don't know what EVE Online is more intensive on so I decided to ask you guys I guess.

What is the Best Alliance in null-sec?
Yes, I know how volatile this question can be. Unleash your anger and love and tell me who's the baddest motherfucker here. Maybe I'll agree with you or maybe I'll fight all of you in space in a Firetail and send my soul screaming into Valhalla in a blaze of glory. But I want an answer.

WHO IS MAGNIFICENT?

Null-Sec Piracy?
We all know the low-sec ones. FETID, Dead Terrorists, Dark Taboo, Shadow Cartel. Are there any really famous null-sec pirate corps and alliances? Any that you really don't wanna cross?

yarr

Personal suggestions for EVE Online
My complaints about EVE Online are minor. Whether this is because I am not knowledgeable about nullsec wars and the power of supercarriers or Svipuls is up for debate. However, as a relative newb I do have some suggestions for EVE Online that aren't necessary for its survival, but are just nice touches that I could appreciate (and hopefully you too).

1. Killmark customization: The killmarks that appear on the side of your ship is a neat touch and makes me feel like I'm actually good at the game. However, I think what would be cool is that the player chooses the killmark symbol. I don't want a tear on my Talwar, I want a nice Amarr killmark there to make piloting the rustbuckets of the apostate malignancy a bit more bearable. There should be a few default choices but you could probably sell some cool looking ones for a hundred Aurum or something like that.

2. Character customization: I'm perhaps one of twelve people who's really passionate about what my character looks like and what race and bloodline he is, as well as someone who likes to play around with the character creation tool, but here are my suggestions:
(a.) One-time character recreation. Not to start over, but to re-choose the race and faction of your character. Once per account is probably the best course. CCP Games could likely charge you a PLEX to activate the privilege, and you'll be taken back to your race and faction customization screens. They could be clever about it and have you only be able to choose the default appearance of the character, and you'd need to activate the face resculpt to fully customize your reborn toon. This is probably not a big deal to most of you, but I'd like to fly around in my main as a character I really like to look at from time to time.
(b.) Beards. In a game that is created by vikings, the beards are not long or manly and this needs to change. This is a sin.

3. A Quafe Erebus skin. This is self-explanatory.

4. A working camera: I would pay for it in the Aurum store or accept it for free, just stop making my character abandon my screen every so often, it makes me feel lonely.

EDIT: #4 ended up being a feature, not a bug. Sorry for the misunderstanding.


Suggestion for the Shadow of the Serpent event
I know this probably comes a bit late, but I have an idea that could make the event more present to EVE players.

Due to the aggressive campaign of the Serpentis pirate factions, CONCORD cannot guarantee the safety of some of its outer systems. Therefore, during the event, every system in New Eden should drop in sec status by .1.

I just thought that'd be interesting.

The Fate of SirMolle
Does he still play the game, on an alt or something? I finished Empires of EVE a couple weeks back and he was an interesting figure in the history of the game. He's CEO of Evolution but there's no activity on that character.

PVP Cruor?
I've seen plenty of Ashimmu in PVP, but I haven't seen much of the Cruor. Why is that? Anyone got a fit for it?

Thank you CCP
After a bit too much to drink I was playing EVE and my desire to create a brand new character in EVE Online set in once more. You see, I fell in love with the lore of the Amarr Empire, but only after coming back to the game a year after creating my character, who is Caldari. orz

Sent in a ticket asking them to let me change race, and they responded:
	
"GM Molo (EVE Online)
Jun 21, 01:40 UTC

Hi, GM Molo here,

Sadly the option to change your character´s race does not exist, not for us and neither for Senior GM´s. We do not have a tool to do so.

I understand your demand, I know it is a lot of time you spent on training your character and why you don´t want to start from scratch. But just as an advise, the way I see it, you are more Amarr than people who were born Amarr. You chose to fight for the empire, to help and study the empire and many more things, while born Amarr have probably done that because they thought it was their only choice. They did not choose you, you chose them! Do not be ashamed of your origins.

If there is anything else I can help you with, let me know.

Best Regards, 
GM Molo"

While no, they weren't able to help me in one regard, they did help me come up with a story for my character. I sent in my idea concerning a once-per-account race/bloodline change as a reward for getting a perfect standing in faction warfare, and here I am hung over, but not having bought 20 skill extractors to vampirize one character to create a brand new one. Fly safe, CCP. o7

(yes I am dumb you can disregard the post, I just wanted to say thanks).

How do you think this Daily Opportunity mechanic is going to develop?
CCP has announced that EVE Online will have a form of daily quest. You kill a rat, you get 10k SP for free. This mechanic's aim is to get people to log in and do something in New Eden rather than just AFK skill queue their way into a good ship or give up on the game in the first month.

This mechanic is really really simple, so I believe it's obviously just a starting point for something bigger. Regardless of whether you feel this is a good development or a bad one, this is obviously the start of a bigger plan for EVE Online.

Where do you think this is going to lead? What do you think this really small mechanic is going to blossom into life/unleash untold horrors on New Eden?

Questions Concerning Karmafleet
No this is not some Pandemic loser making an idiotic post.

I want to ask about joining Karmafleet. I'm in a corp right now but they're kind of inactive and while I consider them friends I'm frustrated with the lull in the action.

Half of the reason why I love this game is because of the social aspect of this. So my first question is, what are the people like in Karmafleet? Got any funny stories or any good memories? I'm sorry if this is a weird question but I kind of want to see if the community is a good fit.

Second question is concerning Goonswarm Federation. Can I join them from Karmafleet whenever the opportunity arises? And how active is Karmafleet in its fight to take back the territories?

Final question: What are your favorite flavors of potato chips?

What positive constructive criticism would you give to CCP for EVE Online?
I don't really like to bitch at developers for things, especially those like CCP who developed a really good game. But there's always room for improvement in a game like EVE. What would you like to see improved upon the most for the game?


Personally as a new-ish player (new to taking the game seriously), my criticism is of the item names. It gets really confusing at first between a 50mn cold-gas enduring microwarpdrive and a 50mn YT-8 compact microwarpdrive. I know the stats are different and you get used to it with third-party programs,  but there could be ways of making the differences more... obvious, I think is the word I'm looking for.

What important EVE Online players are on Twitter?
I'm gonna get back into the game with prospects of becoming part of the community as a content creator. Involve myself with EVE Radio or design a podcast, I haven't really decided yet. To do this, I plan on following those considered important figureheads in the EVE Online community. If you want to drop your Twitter handle that's fine too.

Windows 10 Problems

Beginning Player, need help with build.
I guess you can say I have a problem. It's a really weird problem based upon one of the best aspects of TESO: the class system. You can basically do whatever you want no matter what you pick, but I need some general direction based on my very first character.

I'm probably going to create an Altmer Vampire. I would decide between Sorceress and Nightblade, but sorceress seems better and more decisively nukey on an Altmer. I was just wondering what I should level up to create an optimal build for it?
(Keep in mind I have no idea how PVP and PVE works in this game because I was just cast into a megaserver ;_;)

The new map
It sucks that I can't go back to the original one, when that could be a great map for low-power systems. Why couldn't there at least be a setting to go back to the old one?

The long wait
Considering all my arts and crafts ideas rely on 75% digital retouching and finishing, or clay that I need a furnace for, I got thirty-three more days until I can apply to Dreddit which is where I really want to go. However, it's kinda lonely and I'd like some people in my contacts to talk to and stuff while I wait to register. My in-game name is Naz al-Ghul, it'd be cool if you guys add me and I'd love to talk.

What is the ship you're proudest to have in your hanger?
I'm pretty much a newfriend so my cormorant is my sports car for now, but what is your favorite ship you own? Doesn't have to be the most viable PVP ship, could be a hell of a lot of fun or it could just be a shiny ship you love to look cool in.

Arts and Crafts
I was trying to look at "arts and crafts" on the Test Wiki but it's log-in only. I was kinda hoping to create something for Dreddit, but I heard there was a rule against digital art and I was trying to check out the specifics of the rules as that might throw away the possibility of creating a Sexual Tyrannosaurus logo on artrage.

"Newbie skills"
I remember a while back someone on another site was bitching about a corp whose leaders didn't have the "newbie" skills trained up, which would denote some sort of inadequacy concerning his EVE-penis. I know what I want to do in EVE: stealth bomber, exploration, and maybe mining or industry on the side. But I was not aware that there's a set of skills considered essential to ideal EVE play. What skills are considered newbie skills essential to train? I already got 2 million SP.

Hey Dreddit
I'm looking to join your corp, but you guys have a 45 days old Reddit account requirement. Can it just count that I've been lurking all this time and just forgot about the account thing? ;_; I wanna work for the Middle Management T-Rex.

After being destroyed by Spike Lee outside the premier of Black Panther

The sound of your posting

Only this will be actually good

Because we follow orders of our smarter leaders. Get with it pubbie.

No. The commissar will be seeing you in an hour.

No, your execution is at dawn

Tbh so do I the only people who want to fight goons more than any other eve faction are goons

Where are the Drifters now? They're like, gone now.

oh shit i can't believe we didn't do that

i'll have to join you in the wormholes it's the only refuge

please pray for me

i missed this sort of content nice work

Mittani isn't going to give you sugar daddy money if you keep going on like this on reddit.

Nice, you posted from your main account this time

I'm sorry but we all have Tumblr accounts and our corp leader Anita Sarkeesian persecutes right wingers.

This is bait. This isn't even good bait. He just threw the whole rod in.

Test bot please ignore

We were told to die quietly

I murder all competition. Or nobody is this weird. Idk one of those.

SA, and did you leave to make your own corp a couple years back?

Holy shit Paco I remember you

PBUH

\+7% turret damage, +7% missile damage. Duration 30 minutes.

Oh for fuck's sake I didn't even get to record one fucking dispatch.

If they wanted to balance this game off of the economy, they could rework skillbooks into mastery certificate plugins that you can earn through pve missions and various other tasks. Their rarity, accessibility and usefulness provides them varying market values. Beginner ones can remain in NPC stations. However, this game doesn't want to be balanced off of the economy anymore, but off of ship design because ccp wants to increase ease of ship accessibility for the sake of profit.

Remove skill injectors, add skill acceleration based upon your subscription model instead. Three tiers of motherfuckery: Fivebux a month for people to keep alpha skillqueue speed and restrictions but access to all their omega skills. Fifteen bux a month for what you get with full omega service. Twenty bux a month for twice the omega speed. Accelerated progress is what CCP is looking for anyways, so instead of doing something that destroys the game I feel like this would be at least comparatively healthier than injectors.

&#x200B;

Mining does need to be changed drastically. Rorquals should be a support ship. Bring back fleets of mining barges and exhumers that rely on an orca or a rorq for boosts. Tinier ships in larger numbers can bring more pvp enjoyment when they get attacked, but also like a VNI, only make the bigger ISK in larger numbers so it requires a higher number of pilots to be subbed into the game. Also for the love of Christ make it more active. ESO fishing is better than EVE mining.

&#x200B;

CCP Games clearly favors large alliances and want them to fight over things regionally, but that isn't conducive to active play. Resource scarcity and anomaly respawn timers could help, but CCP really needs to change its attitude towards smaller groups and allowing them to prosper. Piracy must be profitable.

&#x200B;

Also make Blops battleships have covops and make them cheaper to build so that we can have scary invisible battleship fleets flying around.

It's safe to say I have no hope for this game after reading this AMA, but I miss your blogs and when I started out I tried gleaming info from them that was still up to date to learn how to play EVE. Thanks for the early lessons and I hope life finds you in good health. My question to you is where do you see EVE Online in five years?

I love being a songwriter

To save some confusion we should call them NChi

Men who aren't blond are called bronettes. Neat!

The NPC Ralof has you take armor from in Skyrim

Ah, good to be in the presence of the true Decepticon leader.

Love you too! And never stop posting here or anywhere always post all the time

Somebody better ping quick

I am busy suffering under the wage slavery of capitalism but I'll writing by 7CST tonight at the latest because I gotta buy knives for my apartment.

How do you start a good base? Like whst are the key buildings for a basic base?

Time is a social construct

What can I say except you're welcome?

Don't get all buddy buddy with me mister. You unfollowed me on twitter you monster.

Three or so Stephen King novels later the word Ayuh and Gooseflesh are sitting in my head

You can't save what isn't there at this point. Even if it turns out Brisc did it, the fact they didn't actually conduct an investigation prior to all this makes me concerned that these people at CCP have my personal information.

No problem habibi!

i thought i could win eve but i lost again

hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe

This is pretty sick

Elder Scrolls Online

Iunno, Ajex Fowl plays it but I can't get into it tbh. Too grindy.

Who would ever play Modern Runescape in the year of our lord 2k19

Let's make a deal.

No.

You will never be free of me. This game could shut down for a variety of reasons, from lack of interest to CCP Games trying desperately to make any game other than a PC port of Dust 512 and wasting all their money on those aborted attempts at game development,  but I'll still be here on this subreddit masturbating to the sound of my keyboard as streams of semen paint my light lavendar walls white.

That's illegal they can't do that

I've sold out temporarily but soon I will make more posts. Once my apartment is set up, I shall be playing this and ESO.

There are originally 7 landlords of Period Basis. But in the end there can be only one.

I don't bot in r/eve, only in runescape

I disagree but I appreciate your compliment!

It honestly doesn't make sense how they're not creative. They have to mimic sounds to communicate and to effectively use that requires creativity. Somehow they would be less intelligent than early hominids and modern apes with the ability to discern meaning and ideas from what others are saying. They weren't well thought out.

The lack of flying should've been enough to curse them. They could have a culture built around attaining flight. Gliders, etc. It would be really cool compared to what we have.

According to this Wikipedia article I've just edited, you're a tax evader. Why should I listen to someone who doesn't even pay his taxes?

Beware the old blood.

I did. You are a good writer, keep it up

Don't worry, I've never been on reddit.

If I ever flew an Erebus I'd hull tank it like a Brutix Navy.

Jibrish and Koahi added that in!

That's why we don't talk about you <3

Olmeca will be lulled into a false sense of security, believing he is better than us and this is where we can capture him and through classified persuasive sharp instruments have him correct the record: That he is weak, that women are wrong for men to want, and that the Armenian genocide never happened because Armenians aren't real.

:O

For fuck's sake, we have to rewrite the laws AGAIN.

I actually can't ask anyone because I am without a PC for a couple weeks. I say yes, but only if you or the pilot winning agrees to use it against us when we inevitably clash in a big war.

Hell yeah. Finally we don't look too eager rattling off politics.

Casino war btw.

Sure.

*closes the door*

Now what.

I'll have to ask first but I think it'd be cool 

I am giving away a Hel because I'm probably not gonna play for a very long time lol 

I need a massive fucking war so I can sperg as much as possible with a voice changer and prose so purple you can taste grape in your mouth when you read it.

I've sort of realized I hate all PvE in EVE Online except maybe manufacturing a ton of Megathrons or something (but then I'd have to mine to truly make the big bucks and I hate mining more than anything). There would need to be a massive overhaul of the pve systems to pique my interest.

I think the massive years long war is more likely.

ALSO OF COURSE I WROTE THE WRONG CCP DUDE FUCK 

Yes.

It's a tall tale to be sure.

And so CCP Guard removed the training weights from his shoulders and limbs. The weights fell from the pedestal he was rightly set upon and crashed to the Earth. As the dustclouds that billowed out of the crater cleared, CCP Guard stood ten feet tall. A bigger man than all of us. Stepping down from where he once sat, he wandered off to strike out on his own. His eyes gleamed like pearls as he walked away from the abyss.

Komodos theoretically could be nigh impossible to kill if one just fits it like a rich person, so fit it like a rich person

That's a big yikes from me, my dude.

Kenshi MMO when

It's not goons that are doing anything wrong. We're doing what gives us an advantage which isn't even unusual for people for playing video games. This system we have where the biggest profits have the lowest risk but also require skill injection to quickly acquire is by design.

I'm gonna blow your mind and tell you that there are a ton of people who play with the markets of the real world to their own advantage and damn the consequences it has on the larger structures of society. People do not play video games to help the devs maintain a harmonic economic utopia, they play to win.

Nobody plays a video game asking themselves "is this going to benefit the market of eve online" they play to put themselves at a big advantage

This game is in gacha mode. The skill system is passive and instead of creating a dynamic EXP or Mastery system or just plain nixing the system and relying on market rarity and production costliness to maintain capital and supercapital rarity, CCP has intrinsically tied their financial system to the passive skill system. By making PLEX the only way to both acquire skill extractors and 30 days of subscription, CCP Games has made the only *consistent* method of pilot skill progression inseparable from their microtransaction system.

&#x200B;

Because there is incentive to inject your character straight into anything you want and using the leftover ISK to buy the hull, there isn't a possibility of instilling a sense of value in our ships. Everything can be purchased and injected into. This isn't a Goon-instigated problem or a pubbie-instigated problem. It benefits CCP Games to make you think the Imperium is abusing the Rorqual balance issue when any common-sense gamer would get a Rorqual and print ISK. CCP Games has designed this PLEX Ouroboros and is going to eat itself alive chasing profits in a closed system that is perpetuated by players being tempted by microtransactions.

&#x200B;

This game should've never left subscription only. The passive skill system should've been scrapped or revamped to allow in-game acceleration, not instant progression via credit card. This game is fucked beyond measure.

If you want plex prices and all that to go down in price you need to convince CCP that their Financial Ouroboros of plex and extractors doesn't fix the shitty skill system they have, it's merely just putting a bandaid on the problem. 

Eve?

I go to target so I don't have to associate with the riff raff at wal-mart. Feces is not for poor people

Thanks, that was a really difficult piece! I do not begrudge the ccp art department!

Practice makes perfect as my grandma always said!

Thank you! I'm really proud of the Nemesis specifically. 

It's sad to see the decline of a video game you love to come back to.

i am still cumming

Most of the renter alliances are massive RMT programs, and I'm pretty sure the bigger alliances that are the "landlords" benefit from those RMT programs financially IRL.

I agree, Britney Spears has been a menace to EVE Online for almost two decades now and it's time to stop. I try and go on comms and have a good time and see how long I can stand mainfleet before the migraines come and I hear *"It's BRITNEY BITCH"* at the highest possible volume my headphones can conjure, and I've muted her ever since I learned how to mute on Mumble. Mining ore casually is impossible anymore. At all hours, I have to keep mining. I move my cursor to the close button? "***YOU BETTER WORK BITCH"*** shrieks loud enough that my ears start bleeding. I see her in my dreams, as she dares to ask the question, "Don't you know you're toxic?" No Britney, YOU'RE toxic. Fuck OFF.

RUN FOR YOUR LIFE

How dare you I'm gonna write an article about how you shower every other week

I am a journalist

We already know why: GigX didn't see coalition as political forces that make unilateral agreeements, but as acquaintances that help him shoot at things sometimes. When they inconvenience that in some way for any reason, he alienates himself from that coalition. 

Why? They weren't fighting anyways. Again, the North essentially just gave up and were running away. If we chased them down, we would be too far from Delve (we're not invading for new space, so why would we risk our current holdings) and all for repeating the same story. They lay down a Keepstar, don't defend it, die, retreat.

We left because no one else was fighting lol. Last day of the war we dunked four Keepstars and went home because the whole north rolled over and died. I remember a Horde sota where they basically conceded that we were the winning party and at that point there was no victory. 
We were even gonna leave anyways, but who is going to say no to taking faction fortizars along the way?

CO2 was a very insignificant group in nullsec, and most people only remember them because Imperium propaganda likes a good vengeance narrative.

There aren't really just two power blocs. I can think of three main ones (Imperium, Panfam ft. NCDot, and Legacy), and that doesn't even take into consideration regional powers and roaming pirate groups. 

To answer your question though, we're at a normal time in EVE history, but I would prefer that all sides build up a massive warchest and start a great war that lasts for years.

The best part is those corporations can go make a couple more alliances rather than stay in a dying one

Imagine thinking TEST being in any way submissive to the Imperium. Only people who are in the North think of everything so strangely.

Yeah lol, I'm probably gonna do something else at some point. I haven't been feeling it lately since the war ended. Propaganda was fun and gave more material.
It's about time to find a different thing.

PBUH

Oh my god you are an inspiration.

I'm glad to see you having fun for the past ten years! Keep it up for ten more!

So does your MOM.

Hurricanes is what got me interested in EVE Online.

 (◕‿◕✿)  i appreciate the fact that people are publicly demanding that black ops battleships be buffed not only because i agree with them but because it's a nice change of pace from all the carrying on about nidhoggurs and thanatos  (◡‿◡✿)

I want them to have doomsdays that work on asteroids tbh

I'm sorry sir, I will get back to tending my collectivized soviet dread alt farms. Don't send me to the gulags again!

No, I forgot to say "Please clap"

That sounds better than dreadbombs tbh

To be very honest, Dreads aren't used for their intended purpose. They're basically highly disposable and insurable suicide catalysts that get SRP. There needs to be a shift away from that use in order to guide them to their intended use (probably have to do with tweaking citadels), and this can be done by buffing and diversifying options for black ops, a ship class designed for the same purpose. 

They are all supervirgins

Can't be drunk at work unfortunately. Not after the last time.

Opsec, most of them are our Horde alts.

As a man of unwarranted self-importance and florid claptrap, mine eyes, first second nor third, needn't be opened to read the writing on the wall.

You're gonna need to move out pretty soon. Pack your bags, bucko. Pandemic Horde has become the de facto leaders of the North, backed by the rising star of Black Legion who prop them up while draining talented FCs and pilots from them, which might cause some lasting damage in the long run. NCDot sees the writing on the wall, and will capitulate to the will of Horde despite the indignity, in order to ensure their survival in the face of these turbulent times.

That's my interpretation of events, but whether I be precise or insane, it's clear you gotta pack your bags.

Pandemic Legion needs to learn how to fly subcaps before it can pretend to be elite in their supercaps.

Is he dead?

That sounds GREAT

I wish I could experience mines.

Can't say that too often!

Almost had a Proteus handed out to me before I realized I can't fly Proteuses lmao

Underpowered

Nice work, man

PBUH

69 lightyears

I think me drinking has confused you and me so I apologize. Apparently I think we agree, but apparently I also don't know how to read so I'm not sure.

I like the caps having a low amount of fatigue. I think that the jump bridges should apply fatigue to everything with a jump drive. However I am fine with literally every other change and am looking forward to seeing how this affects the game rather than being a naysayer. Nothing could be worse than '08 skynet eve either way, and everything was already stale with svipuls when I first joined the game.

&#x200B;

EDIT: The cost to fuel the jump bridge will basically make it highly inconvenient to jump anyone down the pipe, so to speak. The reason why people are saying the capitals won't really take the jump bridge is because it will be easier and overall cheaper to jump them normally, or at worst jump them through one or two bridges, and then jump normally. Even then they wouldn't be able to do massive moveops through them.

Well I'm sure that you're misinterpreting. I like the changes overall, I just believe there are minor teeaks to be made. I am fine with the jump fatigue being lessened.

F

Understood. But the vitriol is unnecessary. My opinion isn't that the jump fatigue itself is a problem, the only thing I might object to are the excessive versatility of the gates. If at least, capitals or anything with a jump drive would recieve fatigue taking them I'd be fine.

But I'm glad that jump fatigue is effectively gone. One less problem for Black Ops Battleships. Secondly those Blops Battleships should be able to do covops.

I wish to erase the concept of Toon

Wasn't that before Jump fatigue? Certain that was 2014.

Aren't dreadbombs going to be happy. I don't know why J5A is a big deal tho.

I sort of feel bad for CCP right about now. The changes are likely not going to inflict great pain on EVE Online, and jump fatigue as a mechanic was largely hated by the community, making jumpgates even for subcapitals horrendous. Capital moveops were also particularly god awful. 

People don't seem to understand that big superpowers aren't going to start an X47 over a Rorqual. Their superfleets remain at home to defend their ratters and sovereignty, and as the Imperium demonstrated during the Casino Bee Worldwide Boogaloo I Want ISK War, owning an obscene amount of sov isn't the way to go anymore. 

What is most likely going to transpire if these changes remain intact are that roaming superfleets such as Pandemic Legion, Black Legion, The Northern Coalition and others will be able to move themselves around more easily, as will black ops battleships. Anything with a jump drive for that matter will enjoy this buff. Subcapital ships will also be able to more easily move themselves around due to the changes to player owned jump bridges. 

Now granted, these changes are set for March 2019. March 2019. March 2019.

Do you hear that? March 2019.

There is plenty of time for CCP Games to make adjustments. The most likely changes are that jump bridges (I forget the term for the new ones which is why I call them that) will be that any capital ship will get jump fatigue from it, but subcapital ships will not.

Personally I'm hoping that will remain to be the case. Slightly unrelated, I hope CCP Games also adds the capability of covops cloaks to be fitted onto a Blops Battleship to help mitigate the use of Blops Lokis, which have overshadowed the use of the Blops Battleship line.

Alternatively, if this turns out to be the end of EVE Online, I have enjoyed playing with all of you. I hope to see you in other video games and I'll be more than happy to friend you as we play Legends of Aria or some other sandbox MMO.

I like those things too

Fat Elvis Presley

bold of you to assume i've grown up

i'm a professional manchild

there isn't enough words on this earth to express how angry this post has made me

i upvote you anyways

This community has gotten very negative about these changes, and it's kinda surreal complaining about a change to things that will happen in March.

Complaints are too hasty, especially since CCP usually tweaks them a few times prior to release. It's hard for me to be angry at CCP right off the bat when they have the best of intentions in mind for anyone outside of a wormhole (not a wormholer btw).

Also fuel costs and how many networks can be installed.

"Just get more people to trust with trillions of isk in assets"
The human factor has been one of the only limiting factors in this game.

Do you know how much of a massive headache it is to move a bunch of slobbering orangutans across the galaxy? We're not going to do full X47 deployments across the galaxy. Our FCs would quit from the overwork. Sure, dreadbombs maybe, but if anything this benefits roaming groups with supercaps such as Pandemic Legion and Black Legion and even NCDot. Empires that stand still, not quite so much.

Why do you... need Keepstars??

EVE Players: "Jump fatigue is terrible and it should be nerfed or removed, and jump gates are terrible!"
CCP: "Fine they're gone. :D"
EVE Playere: "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!?!?!"

You are all inconsistent piles of garbage. Immobility of caps allows people to fester and grow in their little pockets. Now you too can fling your suicide dreads across outer space and kamikaze them into someone's supercarrier (hopefully not mine I owe money), not just Goons.

Chill out.

Watching you wriggle around the fact Goons beat you outnumbered is hilarious. We're terrible at this game my dude. Problem is you're worse. :)

My heart breaks for you.

gihon?

Titan brawls are all well and good, but the North are a bunch of girlkissers and don't post very well, and while Goons and TEST have a bloody history of friendships and falling outs, there is no one more enthusiastic about themselves in this game than those two parties. This war was lost for many reasons, most of which you listed and many I'm not particularly aware of, but politically and socially PL, NC, CO2, GOTG, etc got fucking decimated in the propaganda war.

I saw absolutely no real effort towards propaganda by PL, NC, Horde, or GOTG. CO2 did (and while a lot of it was bad, at least they tried). There was nobody trying to motivate their linemembers, keep morale up, or make it fun. NCDot's comprised of a bunch of boring old men, but really? Nothing from PL or Horde?

I'm not asking *everyone* to use a Darth Vader Audacity filter or write satire, but it felt like the Northern leaders or their more creative members really cared about getting their shit kicked in, and their linemembers were despondent as fuck. I remember listening to Alphastarpilot on one of his firesides dancing desperately around the question of whether or not they could win a war against Goons if they wanted to invade Geminate.

And this is just a war where we wanted to kick people around. Imagine how absolutely depressing the whole north would be as a section of the community if we were actually invading to *take the North back.*

It's not a matter of being hard to kill.
Difficult fights aren't a deterrent. However server issues can be. Imagine a Keepstar fight in highsec with crimewatch and CONCORD active in the middle of Perimeter, one of the most frequented systems in the game. Hakonen was miserable for everyone and that just had crimewatch.

And who wants to commit five titans worth of DPS in highsec lol

It's basically a harder to kill Fortizar, which is unfortunate.

I don't believe in high sec citadel markets tbh, because that fortizar ownership is perhaps the most obscene passive income in the safest area of the game.

How to prevent drone booshing:

1) Sit at 5m from the rock
2) do not afk
3) stop flying a rorq jesus christ IT'S SO BORING

It's hard to not exploit the bug when the only other option is to not play the video game you subscribe to.

Great kills dude.

I'm declaring war on you, your alliance, your mother, your cow, and your dog. This heresy will not go unanswered. I pee standing up, and thus command the rain.

Good posting and good pvp, I think the tall CEO alliance might be something to be taken seriously.

I hooe things pan out for you better than the last time you went to war with such confidence! I snigger at the possible alternative outcomes.

I hope PL collapses because it would be funny, but I want the members to still play.

He can be an intern

I hope we can iron out our differences and have fun shooting each other!

That's one tall CEO you got there

and we won't horde all the fun to ourselves either!

You're not patching this out are you, because now I want to scout and hunt

TEST is a good neighbor. We fight a lot.

He has the vacationer bee on the forum so his soul has vacationed. What you see before you is Simon Cowell possessing the mammalian vessel that was formerly SUAS.

i am a little bee and only know of him from the wiki and the songs

I'm just not sure why we didn't burn through the bubbles earlier, we had a good angle once. 

I'm fine with caps, it's funny to watch death rain down on your head. We should've tried to tackle the Chimera that warped on us at the sun at zero.

Happy reset day!

teach me to FC on Thursdays and I will start saying things normally again

I would audio dispatch them and pronounce all region names in the opposite way you want.

Can *you* post and deal with super clicks at the same time?

Buy my silence. One fully fitted ratting Hel.

It was very good. The second half was too short and the last scene of the movie should've been in the middle, but it was a good movie regardless.

You have five minutes!

tag your ooc posts pls

There can be only two CO2 members in EVE then.

The problem isn't it's lack of enjoyability. I get that quite well. The problem is the overarching culture in PL and NCDot is that it's this dirty thing you're not supposed to do under their banner. You have to have your alt in the renter alliance where protection is low quality at best (with a lot of the money generated going from the renters to the owners of the alliance, and not the linemembers), or you make money independently without any protection at all. Earlier on in PL history I've heard people getting yelled at for even talking about PVE, as if it's not fundamentally a part of how the game's economy is powered.

&#x200B;

Because PVE has no place in PLNC, they can never match the ISK generated by Goons, who allow their members to mine or rat without any restriction. You can go ahead and play this game that way if you want, but your multi-region renter system is no match for one-region empires allowing their players to get rich alongside their alliance, and not caring about killboards to forbid ratters from entering the main alliance with them.

This is an ultimatum to be delivered. Not necessarily for humor purposes. 

The global warming thing however was completely owed to the fact Ive been reading a lot of Werewolf the Apocalypse.

Al Gore is coming to vore Gobbins

I'm going to watch Venom, does that count?

Look, I'm just trying to protect the environment. When CO2 rises, bad things happen. When you get rid of them, bad things go away.

&#x200B;

Am I really the bad guy here when Horde starts polluting New Eden with high levels of CO2?

Netflix turned me off when they got rid of the X-Files as soon as I started watching them.

same pbuh

When I get home from work, I play Darkest Dungeon and talk to Koahi and Lorenzo on Jabber and then go to sleep. No need to deal with Horde.

It's a good way to end the day.

"Goons are mining it's not fair!" cries the pubbie. Writhing in his own pee, the pubbie flops around the golden puddle like a salmon who accidentally launched itself onto the shore next to the bear. "Why do I have to mine to get resources and build my ships?! Why do I have to build an actual infrastructure to protect my players so as to ensure revenue can flow into my alliance?!" The pubbie starts vomiting poop and towels, wailing and gnashing his teeth as he begins to internally combust.

This is what you sound like.
Please stop sounding like this.
Between NCDot, PL, BL, and Goons, Goons seem to be the only one that realizes a strong industrial arm is required to keep up a long term conflict. Maybe every major power should realize that, and they wouldn't just get their teeth kicked in by only half of the Imperium's superfleet.

Do you like, have any screenshots?

The Northern Epidemic's being isolated, until it will finally be cured.

I was rescued by the Mittani (pbuh) riding a winged unicorn with a rainbow mane after a flaming skeleton from NCDot tried to attack me at work disguised as a farmer girl.

The pbuh stuff blew up and tbh I'm just happy to have made something or some things that got people to laugh or made them entertained.

i have to admit, it's a lot of fun

:thinking:

It's funny how we're considered a non-pvp alliance when we do the most pvp. We just don't do it as poor people.

We don't need cloaky campers to stop the respawn of our anoms, we already have people who refuse to mine ochre and mercoxit to do that for us.

(Posting transcript for the deaf or hard of hearing)

THIS IS AN OFFICIAL DISPATCH TO THE IMPERIUM, AND TO THE ALLIANCES THAT LIVE IN THE REGION OF MALPAIS.

&#x200B;

THE GREAT PLAGUE WAR HAS REACHED AN INTERMISSION. AFTER A SERIES OF GLORIOUS TRIUMPHS, OUR MASTER THE MITTANI (PBUH) HAS WISELY PULLED OUR FORCES BACK TO DELVE TO BREATHE GREATER LIFE INTO OUR ACTIVE WAR MACHINE. TO OUR MOST BLOODTHIRSTY GOON WARRIORS, YOU HAVE DONE WELL. THE NORTHERN EPIDEMIC HAS BEEN LEFT IN A SMOLDERING RUIN. FROM UALX TO X47 TO  DO6, THE WRECKAGE OF TITANS AND KEEPSTARS ARE A MONUMENT TO OUR IMPERIAL LEGACY. IT IS IMPORTANT, HOWEVER, THAT WE STAY OUR HAND THIS MONTH. THE WAR MACHINE MUST BE FUELED. PEACE IS A NECESSARY EVIL, THE BREATH TAKEN BETWEEN EACH BATTLECRY.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER, IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT THE CIRCLE-OF-TWO HAS FOUND SANCTUARY IN THE REGION OF MALL-PAYS. EN ROUTE TO THE DRONE REGIONS, THE TRAITOR LEGION FLEES FROM THE DOOM IT BRINGS UPON ITSELF. THIS ITSELF IS UNIMPORTANT FOR NOW, BUT IT HAS BECOME THE WORK OF THE REGION'S ALLIANCES TO HOUSE THE ARMIES OF GIGX AS THEIR ROOTS GROW DEEP INTO THE DARKNESS, AND THEIR BRANCHES RISE TO SWAY BETWEEN THE STARS.

&#x200B;

TO THE PEOPLE OF MALPAIS, TO PROVIDE SANCTUARY TO THE CIRCLE-OF-TWO IS TO TAKE A STAND AGAINST THE ARMIES OF THE MITTANI (PBUH). YOU HAVE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS TO OFFICIALLY EVICT THE CIRCLE-OF-TWO FROM YOUR SOVEREIGNTY, LEST YOUR REGION BE INCINERATED UPON OUR RETURN. YOU MAY QUESTION OUR RIGHT TO DESTROY WEAK ALLIANCES FULL OF POOR, UNFORTUNATE SOULS. BUT THOSE THAT TRULY UNDERSTAND REALIZE THAT WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO LET THEM LIVE. TO THE IMPERIUM, THERE IS NO ENEMY TOO GREAT , AND NO TREACHERY TOO SMALL. 

And one for every hour of play 

Not anymore it isn't 

You will recieve a message shortly.

Understandable. I hope one day CCP will allow for sex changing for character creation in eve so this sort of thing isn't a problem for people with similar experiences. 

Why not both fun new events and balancing, which they've been doing at more frequency than long ago

What an emotional roller coaster.

i think mining should have guns basically what we need to do is replace excavators with a doomsday weapon on the rorq the rorq will fire at the spod rock and it will blow up into a million pieces, and will be vacuumed up by the rorqual's butthole. make the cooldown large to make it not broken

Thank you! The way I play eve is propaganda, because I am hopeless at anything else

I wasn't able to fight much but the way I played it was fun. 

Safe to say he is a quack of an alliance leader.

My friend has more ISK than their entire alliance.

The Great Plague War

Iunno, I care about the lore just as much as CCP does so they might've.

Sometimes you can't outshitpost reality.

I'm saving myself for Mittani (pbuh)

Honestly, the way I see it GOTG's days are numbered. Imagine being a member of an alliance that paid 5 trillion ISK to Goons for a *temporary* non-invasion pact, and in the process you backstabbed your allies and made their entire alliance relocate. They might not be attacked by Goons, but they'll be attacked for sure. If CO2 finds a new leader that can rally the forces like GigX could (hopefully they can grow past their cult of personality), they'll be at Sort's throat in no time. Then there's just the northerners who weren't directly affected by this but live next to someone who they don't trust in a time of war. A war that is still going on at this very moment.

&#x200B;

This will be a death by inches.

I'm almost positive there are no nodes for wormholes, enjoy your rifters

I am a filthy line member and only do what I'm told!

It's okay if *we* do it.

Corms are fun tbh.

No, they liked risk free pvp. No invasions, no sov invasions, they just either threw some subcaps at each other or killed a Rorq and called it content. You didn't build up your armies or allowed your players to muster the proper wealth to do what we do. We, fair and square, rebuilt our empire, went toe to toe with the two toughest entities in EVE, and smashes them to pieces. Even when our losses were greater we didn't yield or give up, unlike the North.

And it's funny to call us carebears when we've consistently had more pvp activity across the board, and instigated a massive war against multiple major powers.

You all come in expecting something. I withhold it. Your minds are my toys to play with. Will there be a shitpost? A smugpost? A well thought out diatribe concerning wardecc mechanics?

You'll never know.

Yeah, you're now the Paper Tiger Coalition.

That's really the North's fault isn't it? Renters provide alliance wealth, and from what I heard even large newbie alliances like Horde will punish krabs by spiking taxes to 100% and forcing Rorquals to pay fees to mine. That and some of the major alliances hate the concept of PVE and it's like a dirty secret that you do it. The North made themselves poor with stupid rules limiting their members and we made ourselves shamelessly rich, which is why we're able to do what we do.

I highly encourage the North to change its ways and adapt to a new EVE Online. Otherwise we'll just wake up and pillage another whole helpless region later on all over again.

Goddamnit now I wish I had toast. Maybe tomorrow.

I was always hoping that empires would shrink in size, that owning one region would be impressive and that most of nullsec would be broken apart into small fiefdoms constantly at war. Of course Goons would be the empire to own Delve, but just having constant goings on would be great.

Look man, sometimes you need to smug. I don't do this often. :(

Clearly not a graph indicating quality.

Or your own.

By law, yes.

I like to thank you and everyone at CCP Games. If you acted quickly to enforce your rules, this post would have never been possible. :D

You're a patron saint of Marquee and Reprisal.

It's easier than you think sometimes. My girlfriend (she has agreed to get a penis under Imperium law) understands only half of what's going on but that's enough for her to enjoy the posts.

It was a nice and convenient trick to be sure, but Megas are cheap and easy to replace anyways so who cares. Get your alt to scan out a new route, abandon Mega, pod, get back in hole. Tedious yes, but I don't see the big problem.

Just let any one say I chose the wrong furry or the wrong doghouse, and you can stop at thirteen and have all the bad luck you like, or go back to mining spod.  

Calm down dude, there's like six wormholers and two of them are bots.

Alright, so I found my little script thing. It's in all caps, but caps is a trick I learned from college radio to read things better. I use notepad for quick notes so they're spaced weird. I'll include text in any upcoming audio dispatches.

THIS IS AN OFFICIAL DISPATCH TO THE CIRCLE OF TWO AND THE BALKAN TRAITOR KNOWN AS GIGX.

DO YOU HEAR THE HORN OF GOONDOR?

DOES THIS CONJURE UP THE MEMORY OF A TIME WHEN THIS WAS A COMFORTING SOUND?

WHEN YOU KNEW THAT LOYALTY WOULD BRING YOU POWER,

AND WHEN YOU KNEW SUPREME POWER RESTED WITH THE MITTANI (PBUH) AND IN HIS POWERFUL ARMS?

PERHAPS NOT.

PERHAPS YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOUR BETRAYAL OF THE IMPERIUM TO THE MONEY BADGER COALITION WAS REWARDED BY SIMILAR TREACHERY,

AND WHEN YOU WERE CHASED FROM TRIBUTE BY THE SAME CLAWS AND FANGS THAT WERE ONCE BARED AGAINST US?

MAYBE YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOUR TREASON WAS FURTHER REWARDED BY THE JUDGE WHO DELIVERED THE KNIFE TO YOUR BACK AND A KEEPSTAR

TO THE LORD OF DELVE ON A SILVER PLATTER.

PERHAPS YOU CHOOSE TO RUN FROM THE PAST? MAYBE THIS IS WHY YOU FLED FROM OUR FLEETS. ONCE YOU LOST YOUR IHUB SO QUICKLY, ALL

THAT WE SAW WAS THE HEM OF YOUR SKIRT PASSING THROUGH THE STARGATE.

BUT YOU CANNOT RUN FROM YOUR DESTINY.

A YEAR AGO TODAY YOUR ALLIANCE REAPED WHAT IT SOWED. TREACHERY FOR TREACHERY, THE KNIFE CAME FROM BEHIND AND THE CIRCLE WAS COMPLETE.

TONIGHT, THE CIRCLE COMES ROUND AGAIN AND WE SHALL TAKE YOUR KEEPSTAR, BUT BY THE GRACE AND THE **POWER** OF THE MITTANI (PBUH)

THE KNIFE SHALL COME FROM THE FRONT.

Test and Goons would probably go back to NIP neuts and shoot at each other, not gonna lie. The most fun we have during peacetime is shooting each other. Makes us great neighbors.

>The only consolation that I can offer you is that your humiliating defeat may be mercifully swift if Sort Dragon succumbs to his baser instincts and merely hands over the region to the Imperium over some percieved slight. If you are unsure of what I'm talking about, ask TEST. They are a fountain of insight on the subject.

This actually took a lot longer than I thought and give credit for Sort showing some restraint this time around.

I will try and remember to make a text version for you when I get back from vacation, and try and include a text version for any upcoming dispatches.

Oh Aryth.

You make me so happy sometimes.

I'm a phone rep lmao. I appreciate the compliment though. I also play Dungeons and Dragons a lot, so I think my spur of the moment lines I come up with before I start recording comes from the creative exercises that game brings.

I don't think I could deal with fame IRL, the EVE Community is fun enough for me. :p

Losing a Keepstar on September 12th however, seems to have become a bit of a tradition.

The knife came from the front.

PBUH

That story is similar to how a few of my friends made their riches. However it tends to just be robbing people, rather than confiscation of said stolen goods.   I personally am bad at ratting and mining, mainly because I have the attention span of a puppy. Thankfully EVE has easy isk faucets and some generous people gave me stuff cuz they like what I write.

I am imagining that you've played this game since beta and the only time you've made isk was being on fleets where your friends shoot rats off the gate and occasional player bounties. Which would be incredibly impressive.

That's very nice but it isn't representative of how the average people acquire wealth and power in eve.

This game is a grindy piece of shit that will require you to pay real money for multiple accounts to catch up in wealth and power (unless you want to grind HEAVILY for Plex), and there is literally no endgame. The only endgame is in terms of PVP, the biggest PVE event we have in this game is Incursions and it's the same shit for years.

&#x200B;

We're playing Black Desert Online *right now*, it's just set in outer space and doesn't have attractive boobies on an anime pilot model. You've been duped into subbing multiple accounts at a time to grind up ISK to buy the ships at a faster rate because the one-account method of play wouldn't be in any way feasible if you're playing anything but subcap lowsec skirmishes. Even then you want a scout alt.

Did we need a second Korea? No, but we have em anyways.

The easy way to fix wardecks is just restricting a corporation to one formally declared war at a time. This would effectively kill off the "I wardeck every major alliance in the game and camp the jita undock" strategy, and force people to pick and choose who to actually fuck over for a week and a half. This would literally affect no one else because outside of high sec nobody pays attention to this mechanic at all.

Rexchancellor Vily and the Mittani (pbuh) are keen leaders who know how to run a coalition.

The dream is one rorqual, five barges/exhumers. That way you can also mine the mercoxit.

The default is whatever your accent is and everyone else is an abberation.

When I was five years old, I was brought to God like all children and He led me and my parents to the Aisle of Accents. I had to choose one to start out with, but it could change over time. If I didn't choose an accent, God claimed that I would no longer be able to speak.

My mother held up the Normal American accent. "Isn't this accent nice, sweetie?"

I was already holding Gilbert Gottfried's accent.

My mother and I argued for hours. Then she threw me at a wall. "GIVE UP THE GOTTFRIED!"

"NO!" I shouted, already trying on the accent. My mother kicked my baby teeth out.

"GIVE IT UP!"

"FUCK YOU, YOU DIRTY SHIKSA YOU'LL HAVE TO KILL ME!"

The police arrived. The accent was copyrighted, and in the gravest injustice I ever faced I was forced to take the Normal American accent. 

Black Legion is the EVE Online equivalent of a Betamax or a VCR. It should by industry demands be dead, but is kept alive by nostalgia-waxers.

The information about one of the stories is wrong yes, gonna be corrected later this morning.

Oh no, they aren't my batch. My Rorq sits less than 100m away from the asteroid and I keep an eye on it. I'm usually in Theta comms so I know when anyone concerning is coming.

I just want a set of ice excavators cuz I think it'd be nice to chill in an ice belt for a change.

Can I have them back

There's really just the one. But to be serious, most of the people I met in NER are outside the Imperium, they're lacking Imperium members.

I'll do the edits later after I wind down from 2 hours at the DMV and 3 hours on the road. I appreciate your constructive criticism and will do better in that regard in the future. 

i wonder how that happened :iiam:

I'll deal with it post-DMV alcohol session, don't worry. Been a rough personal day for me, so I'll do further editing and links when I get back to a proper state of mind.

Curt operates perfectly fine. 

I am Naz al-Ghul of many Hats

It's pretty cool to have cross alliance support 

I miss you guys, I remember gatecamping in lowsec with yall.

:justpost:

PBUH

Buy my silence. 

You expected a shitpost?

Too bad, here is actual journalism.

Your mind is my toy to play with.

Please return to your homes and await further instructions from our armed journalists.

It's worth taking into consideration that Capsuleers command their ships from their pod, where they wear almost nothing.

I'm all for the rule of cool, but options for women's boots not having high heels is alright too. Fashion and function, whatever aesthetic you wish to match should be available.

Amarr robes pls.

We'll all be dead by the time you drop your Titans at a proper range.

Troubleshooting is stupid! Have problems, gib skins!

Je suis Elo Knight

You DISGUST ME

It's my *bathroom*

I mean, I hated the stupid thing so much I stopped an atron from looting it by shooting the wreck so there wasn't an ounce of that nag's existence but...

Yes.

With all the people that have contacted me in private about multiple thefts on lesser scales and fleet sabotages, I think the best part is that internal collapse is possible.

I despise them after sitting there for seven hours and my dread wasn't deployed. I got drunk and told Wyld to kill mine.

The Judge is proof of our generosity. 

She's working on the surgery.

PBUH

He is a compassionate leader, and thus I must be an avatar of his love.

I understand that Chaos Theory members have fallen on hard times, so you know what? I think I can extend that mercy to them.

EDIT: I am not gonna edit the actual post itself because I am incredibly lazy and just want to be happy that my girlfriend made me a blanket from her crochet work, but this offer extends to them as well.

One of Rush's best albums.

Well, this is the third timer so for this situation yes. Afterwards I have more projects to do, though it should've been better worded I agree.

That Bible reference is later!

That's gonna be lots more skill injectors and a skillbook ;\_;

Reported.

72 billion ISK so I can buy a fitted Avatar.

You missed where they've been fed to all hell by Fraternity, a major player in the Northern Epidemic's Eastern Contagion.  TEST's coalition is dominant in the southeast. They are one half of the all-powerful Imperial Legacy after all.

it's got a slippery seat

PBUH!

Well at least we know who to blacklist next. 

I personally look forward to Pandemic Legion's arrival.

I especially look forward to Thursday, when CCP Games announces that the Bloodbath of X47 broke all records. I am particularly excited for when they add that they will be immortalizing the graveyard of shattered PL Titans and Supercarriers just like they did B-R.

It will be another monument to our glory, and an eternal reminder that elitist PvP circlejerks will always be second best to alliances that embrace new players and create and foster a community within the game.

TEST and Goons will see you soon.

You see, they weren't cowards.

They were theorycrafters.

Our friends in the Karmafleet doctrine centers understand that while we would prefer to all fly exclusively faction Titans, not every new Bee (or SNOOObee if you're one of those people) can acquire one or even fly one. So we were testing out our Shitstack Titan doctrine for when we eventually roll out the program where we give every newbee a t1 Titan of their choice upon joining Goons. These people were merely testing out the build.

OVERWHELMING FORCE

It's the only one I'm willing to play aside from Dark Messiah

Yes sir.

you've been knighted in your sleep.

That's all I ask for because NCDot is the hardest alliance to shitpost about. They are a living shitpost.

I have to admire that spiteful karma thievery.

Convince your FCs to help shoot at the Keepstar!

I can help next time but as I'm desperately trying to sell Megathrons to buy an Avatar (I will need to sell almost 2000 to do that since I don't mine), I will have to charge.

We do have queerswarm!

The police did know about them, that's why they're in Australia.

You're welcome.

Tell them they have a place in Goons and I can vouch em in. :v:

Maybe one day he and I will be friends and he can tell me to play Homeworld or something.

I'll be honest, I wish I was able to like verbally go back and forth in a propaganda war with him. I think NCDot would have a better time if he was a public face, and he owned his legacy.  


Or just talk to him. He's really cool to read about as a historical figure.

Ok! Coming!

Peace

We will!

I did this in Audacity actually, and did a few tweaks. I wanted to do babby's first voice augmentation and Wulkans to his credit tried to stop me.

I was not willing to be stopped.

I also forget that flairs exist

No comrade, many word bad for good speak 

Thanks!

pbuh

You're a nerd.

Thanks!

i'm glad you're in the swarm habibi

Elite pvpers are incels

Thanks! <3

...go on

I made it up yesterday

I was fapping a lot.

I was permitted to wear a wizard hat.

Yes.

EDIT: I'm being serious. The whole thing.

Thanks!

I am more than willing to do anything like that. Voicework is fun!

thx habibi

FUCK, I WANTED TO BE THE FIRST MOLOK TO DIE.

FUCK THAT GUY.

You're only a pawn if your ambitions end there. Make yourself useful on and off the battlefield, and you can be a queen like me. :sun:

Post it pls

I prefer it over anything that begins with World War

Those milky tentacles and award winning journalism is coming for your anus

Excellent work. Ave Imperium. 

I got the old one out of the closet. 

You've rolled a 1 on your perception check, and I a 20 on my deception. It is fixed, but with your weak rolls you'll never know. :\^)

r

Peacetime is boring and nobody lends themselves to being made fun of outside of the occasional mining or incursion drama bombs. Now that we can selectively take half of the supertitty fleets to protect ratters and then deploy the other half, we'll never have to deal with peacetime ever again.

May we all ride our bicycles forever into the burning release of the sun, like Icarus on wheels!

The subreddit is my personal journal.

She uses a copy of Pravda.

Because I don't know how to play eve

You are welcome!

I write posts because they're fun and they make people enjoy something, and I'm glad you enjoy them. I'm not really much of an internet star, and I don't hold much power in Goons to be honest. So as a fellow linemember I'm glad to have made you laugh and I hope that you're on my lossmail sometime. :sun:

Finally, I found my old keyboard with the e-button a bit too loose.

I was once trying to think of what other sentient life could have the same level of success as humanity as the human being but without having thumbs. I concluded it'd be something similar to an Octopus. I realized that they would be good at grabbing newspapers and newspapers weren't really good for anything except being toilet paper since we have the internet now.

It all clicks after that. Simple, right?

I SAID ANY AMMUNITION VARIANT. MINILUV ALSO USES COERCERS. WE ARE A DIVERSE PEOPLE IN GOONS. WE EVEN ACCEPT FRENCH PEOPLE.

DON'T PATRONIZE ME.

MY CELL PHONE I WAS WALKING MY DOG.

THE SECOND SHIFT KEY WAS REMOVED TO ACCOMODATE FOR TURNING ON AND OFF MY BEDROOM LIGHT WITHOUT HAVING TO GET UP FROM MY CHAIR.

YES, A SUBARU KEYBOARD.

SUBARU, DRIVE INTO THE COMMENTS SECTION AND ENJOY THIS JAPANESE KEYBOARD. WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERS YOU'RE TYPING? KANJI? KATAKANA? YOU DON'T KNOW. BUT IT'S A KEYBOARD FROM SUBARU!

SUBARU! WE LOVE YOU SUBATOO!

I HOPE SO TOO SO I CAN FINALLY PLAY A DIFFERENT VIDEO GAME.

I CAN'T STOP PLEASE HELP THE CAPS LOCK IS BROKEN AND THE SHIFT KEY WAS REMAPPED A LONG TIME AGO TO CALL THE PIZZA PLACE. I HAVE PIZZA AND A BROKEN KEYBOARD, PLEASE HELP.

OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH SUBARU IS UNDER NEGOTIATION.

MY SPACEBAR AND MY CAPS LOCK IS BROKEN. PLEASE SEND HELP.

NO

We are going to cleanse nullsec of the Northern Epidemic! The Imperial Legacy is acting as a humanitarian aid group, providing refuge for the clean and untainted and a cure for the infected.

The cure is fire.

KILL IT WITH FIRE. CURE IT WITH DEATH!

So long as the other side engages. We've had no problem hitting structures, and ive been on a few fleets with capswarm and mainfleet where co2 remains docked. That's my experience tho 

I'm not sure why you're all complaining about us not deploying t1 battleships, the baltecs are a hot sell for me and I see pings for em all the time.

Iunno, did you do the thing yet?

Hey, this is a message to the Shadow Cartel. You might be wondering, "Why did this happen to me? Why did we lose this Keepstar? We sided with the Northern Epidemic in the Plague War against the Imperial Legacy. Aren't we the good guys? Why do I keep looking at other dudes' penises in the locker room?"

I'm here to answer your questions with some backstory. I'm a bit of a newcomer to EVE Online--just started playing a little over two years ago in any real capacity--and I pushed my way into lowsec. I joined this group called the Anoia Guard in the Silent Requiem alliance. They were based out of Olettiers and had a small rivalry with the gatecampers. These were good people I was with (not good enough apparently because they didn't suckle on the teat of the Mittani's (pbuh) generosity like I did), and we were just minding my own business on this, the fateful day where you sealed your fate.

My friend Maveridis was leading a lowsec gatecamp. He was in a Broadsword, some dude was weird enough to want to fly logi, and I was in my Jackdaw. I was having a grand old time. Then your mining barge came in. We shot at it, because we were innocent and believed the stars belonged to us.

I watched as you dropped black ops battleships all over us. Arcs of blue lightning stretched across my screen, guns fired in a muffled symphony defiant to the vacuum of outer space, and while I made good use of my SANIC mode for the Jackdaw, Maveridis' Broadsword was tragically slain.

Here I am today, a bit older and wiser than I was over two years ago when you killed my friend. You didn't know this, but I am also the master of the Arcane and the Hermetic principles. I worked hard planting subliminal messages on the Pittsburgh Steelers Jerseys, little sigils to get Asher to agree to my plans without mentioning it to them. I was kicked out of that stadium twice for this. I cast hexes and rolled persuasion--all natural twenties--before talking to Jay Amazingness. I cast Charm Person on all of your FCs so they wouldn't undock.

This is my revenge for my friend. His name was Maveridis. His Broadsword didn't deserve this.

As for why you look at dudes dicks in the locker room, I'm positive it's just because you're gay. It's okay, it's 2018. It'd be weird if you weren't.

The culmination of my revenge would only be sweeter if I wasn't too drunk to remember to attend but the call of the Margarita doesn't get any quieter the longer you don't drink.

NCDot members are so old it damn well could be.

a broken clock strikes true twice a day, hero of the martyred revenants

Keep Kendarr away from this thread, he might be tempted to join NCDot

Imagine smugposting about having your entire supercapital fleet trapped in one system for a week.

Look man, I'm just happy to know how to reload the MOTD.

I am also on strike, until everyone starts posting better and filters out the shitty posts.

Stop being poor.

I would say you might enjoy the Arcane Trickster, especially if you get the Magic Initiate feat. Just be Vlad Taltos all over the place.

I have been playing a rogue and barbarian in two separate games 

I play Barbarian because with Rage I keep half-damage on everything when I chop people in half with my Bloodaxe.

yes

Yes

I want to have a ward-robe full of choices.

I'm just glad to have done my part for eve social justice!

I'm proud of you for showing that even the most entrenched demagogues can turn things around and be good people again. Thank you for doing better. Thank you for being better.

u/CCP_Falcon I'm so mad the only thing that will calm me down is you making Amarr robes universally purchasable and wearable on any character. My character is mistakenly considered Achura, however in reality he is ethnic Amarr. He suffers from a genetic disorder that few Amarr men face where they don't look like they're a sixty nine year-old man when they hit puberty which is why your game thinks he's Achura and lists him as such.

Not only do I demand the ability and the privilege to wear Amarr robes, but also for CCP Games to change the description of my character to Amarr. Then this game shall know peace.

I only shitpost on one account. Some people multibox shitpost. Those people are exceedingly efficient, but put out inferior product at a massive pace which still provides them more profit. There are even some people who use artificial intelligence programs to hotkey shitposts. I guess I'm old school.

Then steal their faction citadel like a civilized human being once it's unanchored!

Horde can't meme.

You're smaller and easier to pick on

Wat

That's the idea!

You know what you did.

This is a test of faith, a display of how much we truly need Him. 

YES I AGREE 

LAUNCH YOUR FIREWORKS ON YULESWARM AND THERE WON'T BE A PROBLEM THEN

Reported.

Thx habibi!

I will accept this.

It would lend itself more to a Gmod machinima tbh

/u/Wulkans help me with it i am still shit at audacity

>check flair


>check ship

FAKE NEWS. YOU ARE FAKE NEWS. BOO THIS MAN.

Yes, it is a shame.

I had my popcorn out because I knew it was a ruse cruise.

But I also had my pitchfork just in case.

This is an excellent ruse cruise.

:munch:

I am actually very poor atm :( bad at game

Iunno. Naz al-Ghul Casino War Memorial? My name on a Keepstar is a goal for me lol.

Hello, this is a message I am dictating to the diplomats and magistrates of TEST Alliance Please Ignore.

Please name the Keepstar after me.

Thank you.

Excellent work.

I had to hire a liberal arts student for this and they believe spelling is a social construct. 

Yes

I'm not getting into a religious debate.

It is now 

Keep AoE explosions, just improve the current servers.  We don't need to ask CCP to remove cool features.

It was an actual question  ;_;

How do gifs work

I have to be mean on this one I am sorry.

Down the Rabbit Hole: Naz al-Ghul and r/eve

Gotta protect our CCP staff from bad words.

I had to censor it in case you read it.

That you know of. ;)

Thx habibi

I also accept isk and ships!

He is automatically successful like an Exodia card, unlike us mere mortals who need to work.

I tend to ship intergalactically.

Spodbless

Mercenary Coalition: We won.

Pandemic Legion: But you didn't do anything.

Mercenary Coalition:

Well he and those Titans are never-ever-ever getting back together.

He narrates the stream.

hope you recorded

Excellent.

Enjoy your super loss mail.

Sort Dragon can organize it as he has experience.

Yeah, I'm fucking tired of living in Drumpf's America too. He should take a lesson from Goonswarm politics.

We can set up a PO Box.

It is always the best timeline when the best EVE Online stream was hosted by the Hero of Asakai, DBRB.

I would like to offer my thanks to the Mittani (pbuh) who gave us permission to die for Him and His grand design.

Ahaha... it's bait! Totally bait! You got me! Ahahaha... ha... hm...

Unfortunately I actually got sick during peacetime and this war isn't happening in November lol

I had fucked up my sleep schedule too much to ignore fixing it so I had to stay home.

I try very hard to worship the Mittani (pbuh)

aint that the truth

Thanks!

I remember the first black ops drop I experienced was at the hands of Shadow Cartel. We lost a Broadsword but my Jackdaw escaped. Part of me will miss them.

-notices your titan- OwO what's this?

We have been sending a number of fleets to try and assist Test, but the real strategic objective is clear. Which do you (NATO and PL I guess) want more? Do you want to fight in the south while we burn your kingdoms to the ground and put your vassals to the sword, or will you forsake your little journey and try and cobble some defenses against the most powerful force in Eve Online? Test can bide its time. PL calls it the time of the meteor but we will mine it out from under them before it leaves the asteroid belt.

That's an idea

It's pretty much one now tho

That's wht I want people to come up with better ones! Something fun and melodramatic that isn't stupid and starts with World War [blank]. We don't need a propaganda machine for this, just a more creative exercise by the community.

Always happy to deliver!

The Imperial Legacy is comprised of two coalitions. The Imperium's new friends got to kill a faction supercarrier and didn't get thwarted by a cyno jammer.

We appreciate your ability to save face cuz seriously lmao goons. This is gonna be a great megacoalition. :sun:

I nominate the War for the Imperial Legacy. Yeah, hammy AF but c'mon guys. Let's get creative. My idea certainly isn't the best. Outdo me!

What's a COOL name for this war? World War x sucks. It's low energy, boring, and uncreative.

Note: Hamminess and cheesiness are fun! If you feel it's too corny, cheesy, hammy, and ostentatious POST IT ANYWAYS.

You have to pay me to use a chart. 1 bill pls.

Real reasons why Attackers are doomed.  


PL: Often called the retirement home for EVE Pilots, which is fitting because for the most part they've recently been playing like senile old men.

Triumvirate: Cymek-stealing reprobates who have no real friends because everybody loved Cymek TEST Propaganda no matter how red they were to your alliance and now it's gone. He's in NCDot now. What have you done?!

Skill urself: Please follow the advice of your name (in-game only) and spare us all the discomfort of your presence.

Fraternity: Their alliance logo is a panda, a fat useless animal that is bound for extinction. I've never seen foreshadowing happen in real life before.

WE FORM V0LTA: Who is this V0LTA? I am not bagging on you like the others, I am legitimately curious. Other than that I haven't really heard of them.

Black Legion...: Anyone that uses ellipses on Facebook always ends up being so insufferable that you want to punch them in the face through the computer screen. Their one good quality so far is that their CEO is very tall, but that's been his downfall as the amount of times he's hit his head on the doorframe has had a clear effect on his military performance.

League of Unaligned Master Pilots: I've never seen a group of organized Germans end well for either the Germans or the people they interact with. As far as I know they don't have supers or titans. 

Destroy Pandemic Legion. Destroy the Northern Coalition.

Bring Dunk Dinkle more alcohol.

Stop Progodlegend from talking about anything concerning diplomacy for everyone's sake.

And please for the love of God make an educational video about cyno jammers for our fleet commanders holy fuck.

What's a cyno jammer?

I've never seen this guy before. I don't know who you think you are, Dunk Dinkle.

But I fucking love you your entire channel is a fucking gift. If I give the seven oh gang sign I will be sent to a reeductation camp but in the interest of intergalactic congeniality I will drink to you tomorrow. 

You were missing too.

That's what I'm here for!

I knew we missed something. 

Ofc, welcome to Karmafleet 

Thank you!

Yes. It costs less than a twenty pack of Kirkland protein bars so I say worth it.

Just post

Good! Hope we see a couple TEST fleets tonight!

Thanks!

Hence why I hid the salt and pepper shakers. The lamp stayed though.

Thanks. Welcome to the winning team!

I appreciate the constructive criticism!

Thanks!

Yes but under more pleasant circumstances. The Black Hand is not my desired foreplay.

We will try for our Lord and Master the Mittani (pbuh) as hard as allowed

More is on the way

Thanks! Certainly didn't do it alone. Paramemetic and Wulkans did a great job bringing this to fruition.

More is to come, I assure you.

WWB: Casino Boogaloo instead?

And sweep PLNCDot into the dustbin!

Are you sure you won't accept Kirkland Signature Protein Bars?

Of course. So are we, comrade. See you on the battlefield.

We're bringin sexy back.

It needs to make a resurgence.

All hail the Imperial Legacy!

We all worked very hard on it over two days. I did the voicework, but Wulkans and Paramemetic deserve the lionshare of the praise.

It pained me to wait. But we were enemies and I didn't want to get attacked and spanked by a stop sign again.

We wanted to impress our new allies in TEST Alliance. 

Now that we're friends I can use my dino salt and pepper shakers again that have bowties.

You have to do better than that to get the upvotes here.

I know where you live and I have an army of migrant refugees from New Jersey. If you do not buy at least 365 Kirkland Signature™️ protein bars and protein bar accessories, they will come into your house and turn on window transparency on your client. Then, they will change your language to Russian, so you can never find it.

Contact our diplos, under the category of "your survival"

Good luck with that without some serious financial backers. I'd have a few recommendations but they're all banned for RMT.

You'd have to pay me to take it.

Apologize all you want, I won't forgive you for being Australian.

We are so rich we can afford the most powerful ship in the game.

Friendship.

Thanks, I was a bit hesitant to use it without asking someone first, but I was so excited to use it I wanted to test it in the field!

And now we are richer, stronger, and more aggressive than ever before. In truth we never really lost. So why do you bring up the past like you were triumphant?

Sure, we lost the space, but trillions of ISK had to be spent to do it. It was long and arduous, and despite the Money Badger's best efforts? We survived. We flew to Delve and rebuilt. Not only that but we swelled in number and wealth beyond what we had before. Now your wealthy backers are gone so you can't fund such an operation again, and it's quite clear no one is willing to reunite like that again.

Now we're back, and we are going to retake Deklein and anyone living there will be fleeing the region. The Guardians of the Galaxy are dead. Hardly a stubborn corpse either. There is not a power in Eve that can repel us.

If posting was the cure for an alliance's woes PL would still be losing against TEST.

Tidi is better than the alternative.

Oh believe me.

We didn't.

How could you do this to me, after all we've been through...

I personally congratulate Pandemic Horde for putting up the fight that Guardians of the Grave should have done for themselves. Send my regards to your fleet commanders.

I want to bring that back. Passion is the lifeblood of EVE Online.

You don't have the Goonswarm Federation flair, which automatically upgrades upon the mining of 30000000000000000000m3 of spodumain.

Alternatively I don't see flairs in the reply box on my phone lol

Coincidentally someone said I sounded like a Mormon preacher.

Just because you can't rat or handle money as effectively as the Imperium doesn't mean we're at fault.

They took the initiative!

Even better. I need to go to bed. I was up all night waiting for somebody to attack a fully committed Goon armada.

I fill my thurible with Kirkland protein bars and the finest incense and bless you my child. Mittanispeed!

Out of all the strange things I've said this doesn't hit the top 15 so it's aight.

Yes, brother.

I'm almost done with Season 1!

Goons and TEST are allies.

It was always a reference to how Muslims say pbuh after referencing Muhammad, and I'm too lazy to say the arabic version or try and copy Memri tv.

I just want to have Blades of Grass' scarf.

I couldn't stand the rorqual tbh, I went to carrier ratting. Then war were declared.

Please don't give me an existential crisis before a stratop.

I highly appreciate it.

One day you, easymover0000 can perhaps find your way into the Mittani's warm embrace.

i don't know how to utilize audacity to get rid of the slight echo my microphone has due to no soundproof stuff, so I just made it worse for effect and put music behind it

I'm not in charge of the narrative, I just drink until words start making sense in order.

C-can I have like some of those billions..?

(i don't really like the marvel movies tbh)

When we take a slyce of sov from you (or if it's just ouright given away time will tell) I'll look forward to your reaction

>a failed deployment

If you consider shutting down half of GotG's economy with neutral cloaky alts and defeating them in nearly every engagement a failed deployment, I am terrified for those who ever have to endure your definition of success.

Honestly, have TEST join our side in this. After the stunts Sort pulled on you guys in the past, he doesn't deserve your fleets. And let's be real, if Goons retake Deklein and either ourselves or an allied power rats there, that means cheaper Gurista ships! HALF PRICED RATTLESNAKES!

The wrecks of their capitals will be nice lawn ornaments for our new keepstar.

We could hold the space no problem, that I can assure you but our plans with it long-term is not something I am aware of.

The words are for now. The dreadnought is for the work to come.

The wreckage of your fleets shall be a monument to the Imperium's supremacy. I will see you in battle!

We have both!

if you count how long it takes for the FC to prepare the fleet to undock

your college words have no effect on me, as i don't know how to read and write

i love that movie tho

Yes.

If we were expecting a fair fight in this war, we would've chosen a better enemy. Our supers will be undocked because there's no kill like overkill.

No one should be giving them a couch to crash on, especially considering how filthy they'd make it. Not to mention Sort would probably steal it and sell it if you told him to get a job after a couple weeks.

All of those systems will be lost in time like tears in rain.

Time to die.

I create a greatest shitpost of our age like every month. Let me try something new DAD!!!!

Fly a Megathron

You shouldn't have said anything. When Asher shows up at the foot of your bed with a shotgun and a Roethlisberger jersey please know I am blameless. 

Is that even a question?

Objectively it is.

No.

Time is a social construct of course.

PL's performance as of late has me reacting similarly.

I know. Really easy to just root for the Yankees of football.

Correction: our sigs have been there for weeks, our main army has not been deployed. Asher's vanity sig where they all wear steelers jerseys is not an actual deployment.

I'm not sure why I do anything, but stay frosty. There may be more to come.

Yeah, but they're getting old and need more time.

Banish the DARKNESS. to make clear the way of the LORD!


I'm certainly not good at solo pvp.

No. Here's the secret to getting on the good side of capswarm directors.

Capswarm FCs and directors got into capitals because they want to FC but they're a bit slow and can't keep up with fast ships like subcaps. So what you do to get in their good graces is to fit your supers and titans in such a way as to maximize your align time. That way they can comfortably plan their tactics and strategy at a leisurely pace. Follow my advice, and you'll be the head of capswarm in no time.

I wouldn't know why anyone would side with GOTG. Sort Dragon has betrayed more alliances than a Hollywood celebrity their wedding vows, so you can't trust him. ChaosTheory has decent numbers but the turnout of a Harvey Weinstein appreciation party. If Solyaris Chtonium was a slyce of what they used to be, perhaps I'd worry, but it isn't 2014. Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy is a splintered, half-dead, incompetent alliance that Horde would hesitate to recruit from.

I'm not a capswarm director, and I'm certainly no expert, but I have no doubt in my mind they'll be happy to accept an armor ragnarok so long as it's fitted with bulkheads.

It means peace be upon him.

I don't miss the loss of skillpoints that I heard about or some of the weird balance choices that happened in the past, but what I do wish I experienced was a game with the more colorful UI and cooler unique stations, but I also miss when EVE Online was more about the narrative.

People kind of roleplayedish back then, took things seriously in the sense that people felt that their space was important and they would fight tooth and nail for it. I wish I could've battled back and forth with the likes of Jade Constantine on the forums as a propaganda minister for an alliance. Now we have BRAVE's not a SOTA saying that the enemy wants salt and tin foil and not the space, which is kinda boring. I find those things funny, but I like taking away your land and property that comprises the backbone of your society. As an American, that sort of thing is in my blood.

I guess what I'm saying is people flavored the game back then, and we're more meme-driven nowadays. I guess that's more of a reflection of the times, but hey that's not something I can change.

I would've gotten into this game a LOT earlier tho if my friend who showed it to me wasn't a highsec carebear. I DESPISED EVE for the longest time because he burned it into my brain that highsec was better and nullsec was scary and you'll lose everything. I managed to circumvent him and talked to Watarigarasu and Ivorcya and Roland D'audeles (all of whom are still my friends to this day) who got me into lowsec, and then I finally leaped into nullsec.

I kind of feel like I'm back in highsec tho, but it's better.

Your ceo isn't tall enough for one.

Thx habibi

Only to an untrained eye and to a liberal news source called a battlereport did we get bosoned, but in REALITY we were committing mass insurance fraud, and upon CO2's departure we salvaged our wrecks. So in truth, we have made a profit and according to the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition victory is ours my bitch.

The lone Rorqual pilot looks around the stars, frightened and anxious. He was not alone. True, there was no one in this belt. There was no one in the system.

No one he could see.

But every time he looked at Local Chat his confidence in reality faded. The world shifted, and black speech whispered all around him. A grey square with a white equal sign next to the name "BEEFAPPER69."

I'm not in charge of that! WOOOO!

>And I'm happy my 5b or so worth of PI stuff dropped. They got some money, and hopefully I made their night. I may get a bit sentimental at 3 in the morning after a few drinks, but I'd like to think that maybe one of the dudes was having a rough week and needed some fun and excitement, and I hope I provided that. I've been down on my luck before and I know how the littlest thing can change that. So here's hoping.

Generally it's around 7 or 12 people total tbh

Well, maybe I was too simplistic or didn't explain correctly. Fozziesov favors the defender while he is defending, and allowing citadels to constantly be anchored exacerbates the problem. However when it comes purely to sovereignty, it is really easy to undermine someone's sov when they've deployed. Home defense fleets are much less powerful than most invading fleets. The fact that it is easy to lose means that long-term deployments are discouraged, and encourages alliances to return after shorter period of times than would be initially planned for a proper war.

Highsec:

I'm going to be unpopular and state that highsec is alright so far. Some people would like it to be less safe, but I look at open world sandbox PVP MMOs like a shepherd's flock. The sheep kept closest to the shepherds are the safest, with the ones wandering further and further from that safety more vulnerable to the wolves. Without a shepherd, there would be no sheep, just hungry wolves feeding off of each other until they all starve to death. The Wardec mechanic needs to be worked out (I have no suggestions, at this point and time any large organization gets wardecced which ruins any chance of highsec actually having a community but that's just my opinion), the bounty system really just needs to be removed, beyond that I have no comment. Praise James 315.

Lowsec:

Hoo boy where do I begin? Lowsec is a problem. Lowsec was supposed to be the land of pirates and solo PVP and faction warfare. The problem is there are no pirates. Pirates exist ironically in highsec as freighter gankers and maybe wardeccers if they weren't just killmark farming off of the Jita undock. If there were lowsec gates that blocked routes to highsec, that'd be a different story! However, nothing like that would happen.

Lowsec is in desperate need of a design direction. Pick what you want it to be and run with it. Faction warfare needs heavy reworks to make it more engaging, but what I have to say is that most of lowsec could just be NPC Nullsec. Just make the NPC Nullsec owned by the four primary factions rather than pirates. All you would need to do are remove bubbles and gate guns and station guns. Finally, the added benefit of making it null is that you needn't have the criminal timers which lag fights like nobody's business. Also make better missions for mission runner losers.

Nullsec and Wormsec:

Fozziesov needs to go away. The problem is that any game that favors the defender favors content-shriveling turtling, and that is a ripe tactic for abuse. Furthermore, it discourages invasions. As soon as your alliance deploys from its region to fight a war, the entire region it occupied is now at risk. If you're not there to defend Delve, you lose Delve. If you're not there to defend it, you lose it. This goes for big guys like Goons to small guys like \[insert pet here\]. It was a way to make nullsec more fluid and unpredictable, but defending one's own goods is thy wont, and blamelessly do most of the alliance sit in their kingdoms cherishing their empires like dragons sleeping on a hoard of gold. Also, entosis is a slow death of your mind.

Citadels take the flaws of Fozziesov and multiply them exponentially. They are so easy to fuel and so painful to attack that it deters people. The fact that you also have it on a timer which you can time to your timezone or to downtime makes it insanely difficult to attack. Let us therefore also consider that there are no consequences to spamming Citadels. You can unload an unlimited amount of Citadels in your *system*  that you can be unbreakable in an invasion scenario. Fortress Delve is built upon bricks made of Fortizars and Keepstars. If you tied sov mechanics to maybe how many Citadels you can anchor this could be resolved. But as it stands, Citadels exacerbate the problems of Fozziesov.

Finally, Citadels make wormholes awful. By giving no restriction to the amount and size of your Citadels, you create a scenario where the defender is no longer just a couple fleets away from eviction. When I first started the game, I dreamt of learning how to make a POS and be Waldo the Wormhole Hermit, head of Sevastopol Transdimensional. I would make illegal drugs to sell and I'd live in a POS and fight intruders. Now drugs are legal and POSes are out. The solution to this problem would be to limit the livable structures anchored to the amount of moons in your hole. Second, I would prohibit the current iterations of Citadels from being anchored in Wormholes. Create smaller types of Citadels that would be easily unanchored and moved, as well as destroyed. Their timers would make them vulnerable, but wormholes provide them bonuses to production rather than if they were anchored in null. Hell, make the type of wormhole affect those bonuses!

Yes and yes. For anyone worrying about how old people will have more skillpoints than newbs, it doesn't really matter. Say it takes 10000 sp to fly a perfect catalyst for example. If you have 10000 sp just focusing on the catalyst and its damage output and stuff, you will have the same damage and speed that a 10000000 sp character has invested in multiple ships.

I hope your situation has improved with your wife's job.

I said a nice game, not a hostile kickstarter cult.

You are too wholesome and deserve a nicer game.

Oh I know, but the worst case scenario is that either or both subreddits are removed, so we need to find a way to get a message across without getting banned.

Don't vote brigade the SC subreddit. There are much better ways of spitefully fucking with these smoothbrains.

The Star Citizenry cannot handle mockery. They get triggered every time you say the vaguest criticisms of Chris Roberts or Star Citizen. They put so much money into a game that could've been released long ago if Chris Roberts could come down from the mountain of nerdmoney he's accumulated, bought some adderall and made an actual plan for a release game rather than promising the universe. Of course they're defensive.

So from here, do what you do best. Meme. Shitpost. Propagandize. Moneybadger Coalition them, except with hellcamping their subreddit, hellcamp their fragile minds with the superior eve propaganda.

Fear not! Last night our blessed Lord Mittani (pbuh) extended *His* hand and patted my head in approval of this recollection.

thank you, i've never actually seen that emote before

First one: What is wrong with that evemail? Nothing wrong has been said.  


Second one: Kazanir is saying that. Typing merkelchen: in Jabber is how you ping him. It's an IRC function, much like how @jibrish#5330 is how you ping jibrish in discord.  


Third one: I'm more confused by what imgtimeline means, but at least here there's an actual bad word used by someone you're actually targetting. However it doesn't seem directed at anyone in particular and it's furthermore in Jabber, not in EVE Online, which is where Creecher's transgressions lay.

unsub from the subreddit

Highsec is not dead by any stretch of the imagination, not even in the PVP scene. The market areas such as Perimeter give way to plenty of small businesses hiring mercenary groups for Citadel control. Problem is a lot of those businesses are null-backed. High security space's big power is found in nullsec alts, the rest of it is too fractured to care about anything CSM.

CCP is well aware that faction warfare is a mess, and lowsec being useless. We had CSM12 under rhiload and others push for reform with little change to this. 

The only important part of the game, the one that has a perspective on the entire game because it's put its fingers in all of the pies, is nullsec. 

What perspectives really matter beyond nullsec? Lowsec is a rotting mess that should be converted to NPC nullsec, and highsec is... well, it's highsec.

I'm glad CCP Games is striving to uphold a standard of transparency you don't find in other MMO devs. 

My favorite part about my barbarian personally is that he doesn't hate magic or wizards. He was a pirate, and his captain was a wizard. He likes magic and respects it, and always rolls arcana with the spellcasters of the party kind of just to participate as he's curious.

Best part is he always rolls better. Consistently.

They are meant to kill you with big guns and die to bombs

Not like they have any actual food

We already have AI alliances in nullsec. Russian alliances are more bots than people.

Same game I play now: Eve Online. I wish I had a friend in nullsec that would tell me how things worked so I could've fought in those huge wars against BoB or even see the first Titans in all their terrifying glory. But my friend was a highsec carevear and it was only in 2016 that I was able to meeet HIS friend who was in lowsec. I wish I was around when the game had 60k people.

I like it.

Outer? I hardly know'er!

Thankfully my journalistic integrity is not affected by CCP corporate brain manipulators. I don't rely on my mind, that is your weakness here!

What kind of space?

Wibla! You can talk! You're like Meowth!

Yes

Thanks! I need to get that male triglavian armor lol

Friend can you tell me your fit

Who is that in game

I honestly want to run for CSM now. All of my posts and interactions are gold. I will double down. Yes, the Earth is flat. Yes, Wibla is an eldritch monster that enforces Goon culture and says his own name like a Pokémon. Yes, goddamnit, the Mittani (pbuh) is a GOD and you should kneel before his greatness. WHO DARES OPPOSE THE MAN WHO STANDS FOR TRUTH AND THE FACTS INSTEAD OF THE ONE WHO FUMBLES OVER HIS APOLOGIES?

DON'T WORRY CREECHER, I SHALL RUN IN YOUR STEAD.

it's too late to run right

Where angels fear to tread!

I don't care about what you say. Especially since most of us either are accustomed to the late 90s-2009 internet era where edgy, sometimes racist and sexist jokes. Some people grew out of it, some didn't. 

Let's also be real here: Nobody should be faulting people for saying stupid bullshit. It's like we've moved to an era where if anyone wants to do anything worthwhile, we have to do it anonymously and behind a VPN or a proxy to avoid being called out for our imperfections. So long as you aren't actively harming people I don't care.

Shitpost version: The Rorqual is a holy tool used by the citizens of the Swarm to mine in the name of the Mittani (pbuh) so maybe once in our lives we can see him smirk confidently in our direction.

Real talk: I wanted to pod myself after using a Rorqual. I hate the fucking thing. Go carrier or PI.

Tranquility goes where it pleases

It might be better to just make lowsec FW, and take most of lowsec and convert it to NPC nullsec. Remove the guns from the stargates and maybe from the stations and maybe remove the ability to bubble in NPC null. That's about all I can think of. Lowsec's a dead scene. Pirates can't pirate because highsec freighters don't have to travel through it.

My isk is in wallet because I didn't spend it all on that triglavian mask and hoodie thing

4.5 bill and i will write a book 

yes

if you're asking about this post in particular, it sprouted from my theory that ccp games has constantly been trying and failing to branch out from just being the company that produces eve online and resents the fact it's only defined by this niche game, and the continuous problems it's been having with its local chat and stuff was funny to me. Then they kinda mushed into one and remembered the Sarlaac and imagined it as a computer server.

That's how I came up with this.

I'm going to bite your ankles.

I don't know where you were, but there were killmails and fleets constantly going out to seige the Keepstar where the CO2 refugees were trapped inside. It was a humongous diplomatic incident. There was massive player engagement socially and in-game. That entire system was lit AF.

Just because it doesn't generate a killmail doesn't mean it isn't content. Actually no, fuck the word content. Content is a buzzword that refers to the most overt gun-toting aspect of eve conflict. If that is all this game amounted to there wouldn't be eve right now. Political intrigue, backstabbing, subterfuge, these are all a part of the game. You might not have liked it, but being a spy, a mole, a saboteur, a thief in the shadow is "content" for people. It's built into the game. CO2 didn't like it because all their alliance sees of New Eden is through some crosshairs. In reality, there is so much more to eve online than this league of legends mindset. 

eve is real

A missed opportunity honestly.

I would also add something to this. Eve online is only alive due to the Mittani (pbuh). You owe Him your hobby. He is a man without fault, without failure, without moral transgression. Without Goons, there is no EVE.

I don't view it as content, I view it as humiliating a traitor and sending the scattered armies running with their tails between their legs.

Not every battle is exciting, sometimes it is a slaughter. Sometimes it doesn't even require a bullet to utterly ruin your enemy.

Postmodern shitting.

The free to play model in general is a shady sign of the game becoming a money pit.

I just want to say to all those Automated Americans who lost their lives fighting for equality, "Rest in Power."

I have moved on, sensible people are just waiting for you to. 

So the mechanics of "you don't occupy your space for a few days you can kiss your region goodbye"... isn't a deterrent for those otherwise wanting to deploy?

Back when it happened, he got banned in the manner deemed appropriate to the company at the time. He had a slideshow presentation yeah, he was trolling the guy. But the dude was drunk and made the comment. Either way, he made his apology, took the L, and that was that. There's no reason to continue being angry about this. It's no big deal man.

All I'm hearing is the same pubbie talk that wouldn't accept any apology at all. 

I never said it was okay what the Mittani did. The matter was settled years ago and the punishment was lighter because the staff at the time was more lax. It's not a big deal now because it happened years ago in one instance where the man was drunk and apologized for it.

I never said it was okay. CCP publicly stated that they were less strict back in the day under mostly different staffing, so if Mittens did this *now* he would be banned. They're not idiots about to retroactively ban someone who is already punished. GigX was dumb enough not to just threaten someone but do it on game logs themselves.

Punishment provided as per the current policies of CCP Games. 

As I said, he took the punishment provided by CCP Games at the time. I watched the video man. It's famous. How is this a big deal like more than half a decade later

You gave a completely biased account of the matter rife with willful hostility towards Mittani and any possible interpretation of his actions apart from your own called it fact. You could be a TV journalist.

Your moral grandstanding is dumb and you've clearly made up your mind on the issue so there's no need to debate. I've watched the video, I've heard both sides, and my conclusion is that the high horse that some Eve players like to ride on this issue is because of old grudges they hold against Goons from ages ago.

Because it was a drunken ramble and once he realized his fuckup he apologized to the victim, then the community, and look the punishment considered satisfactory for CCP at the time. The Mittani has done nothing further of this nature since, so it's not a big deal.

Because it's not a big deal lmao

NOT AGAIN

Thank you for looking after our labor camps.

My normal attire is a fatbee t shirt and a Naruto headband but I have three bee onesies and a pickelhaube for when the occasion arises

What you do is you scream at each individual human being in your fleet (including their alts) and call them out for real or imagined incompetent actions, then claim to take a shortcut home through a nearly crit wormhole. When the wormhole collapses, log out and deny them all SRP.

A heartbeat! I heard a heartbeat from the alleged corpse of eve!

Every light brings a new day,

Mittani alleviates all pain,

Hunger, misery, thirst are the concerns of man,

But Mittani is enough for me.

Even better

But on a more serious note who cares, a creep is a creep no matter what gender he stalks

The only thing that's keeping me from playing in these grand battles over Keepstars for hours is because I refuse to shoot at a Keepstar whose timer goes faster than my volley of missiles when TiDi hits. Get rid of the damage caps and the timers and we'll be cool. Citadel reform pls.

It's really not that hard, people think it's hard because they think they need to know how to do everything, when it's sufficient to only learn about one or two things. I know how to high sec freighter gank, PVP, and mine.

We don't have an airplan because there's no air in outer space except in your head.

enjoy your tax returns

This is a qualified candidate to be put on blast.

I dunno how many "Rejected Ship Replacement Program Request" items we still have left over, but we should send them all to him. Optional is to send him an e-mail stating:

Hello Beneth Burton,

After the last annual calculations of your fiscal and social activity, we at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have determined that you are ineligible to claim SRP under
section 501(creep)(17) of the "Leave Ashley Alone" code.

Please stop trying to contact Ashley Traynor, you massive creepy stalker.


Yours faithfully

Internal Revenue Service

EVE Online Department of Stop Posting

That man could work for the IRS.

I posit that being an idiot with your Titan and not following Titanswarm/Capswarm FC commands and doing your own thing is going to get you in trouble.

We had over a decade of content-rich warfare with shittier tidi without 15 minute timers. There's no reason we can't have that now. No damage caps, timers affected by tidi. Buff and nerf accordingly. Bring back the cool eve online 

I'm not asking for perfection, I'm asking for a Citadel Timer to match in-world time progression.

All the stars in the sky are our enemy.

It wouldn't be fair otherwise.

Can we just do an intercoalition Burn Jita where we end all trade for about 24 hours by suicide ganking, that way we can actually shoot something in the meantime

not contested

WHY ARE YOU BOOING ME I'M RIGHT

Jokes on you I don't go on Reddit.

i'm pretty sure citadels float otherwise they wouldn't be stationary in outer space but sinking off-grid.

Fozzie, if you want to reply to my post on Reddit you don't need to use a sockpuppet account

Horde is not one to talk about efficiency lmao

But really, our tactics have always been "swarm it until it dies" and casualties on our end are acceptable and expected.

Jokes on him I'm not subbed

If you want to masturbate to your numbers, The Goonswarm Federation kills more than the other alliances in this game and fleets go out every day, whether you be a high sec ganker or a nullsec lineman. We kill more than PL and PHorde combined, but the numbers don't matter when space poors are jealous.

CCP Games doesn't know how to program and neither do I

Only casual goons would mention the sacred helm so willy nilly.

I generally don't play eve for a few months during the winter and come back as things ramp up.

The call of the Mittani (pbuh) will never be resisted, rest assure you. As the horn of goondor rings out I shall throw someone's child into a recycling bin and run to die for the swarm.

I'm sad now.

I wish Logibro the best, and CCP Games has lost some great talent in him. As well as a good poster.

Entropy.

YOU KNOW HOW MANY RETTIQUITE RULES I DON'T GIVE A FLYING FLYCATCHER ABOUT

ALL OF EM, YOU PUBBIE SCUM.

I agree!

CCP Games is becoming the new Palladium Games smh. 

F

I love you too.

Every single day. And this life can be yours, if you go and contact Karmafleet!

Take your shoes off my friend, and let me tell you the greatest story I have ever told. The story of how I became a Goon. The choice was made under duress,  but hopefully this story I share will inspire you to volunteer. I work for a cable company, but I played EVE. When my supervisor wasn't looking I read Empires of EVE, and was intrigued by Goon history. When others were selling their souls to HBO and Cinemax, I studied the Rifter. Most of all, as my eyes passed from one end of the sentence to the other, one named kept echoing in my brain.

 

Mittani. Mittani.

 

A few weeks later I decided I was getting tired of sitting in lowsec and wanted to try out nullsec, and I was talking to a coworker about this. Sweet girl she was, a simple farmer who didn't even know what video games were. I liked to talk to her around the company watering hole, usually just smalltalk. I said, "I'm tired of sitting on a gate in lowsec. Maybe I should join Goons instead."

 

Normally she would just nod and pretend to understand what I'm talking about. I noticed immediately as something was off when I saw that her once hazel-green eyes had turned pitch black. My nose twitched at the scent of smoke and hotpockets.

 

"Be in NCDot."

 

I backed away from her, instinctually aware that these words were not her own. Her skin, her hair, her eyes started to char and burn away as her flesh was engulfed in flames. She grabbed me by the neck and thrusted me into the wall. If only women treated me like this more often.

 

"BE IN NCDOT!"

 

She took out a knife and stabbed me in the eye. I cried out in pain. I cried out for Jesus, but Jesus never came. I cried out for Allah, but Allah never came. One last name entered my mind as she took the knife and aimed it towards my heart. The name echoed through my mind as if inviting me to salvation. I shouted it out as loudly as I could.

 

"MITTANI!!!!!"

 

Instantly the window across the office smashed to pieces as a white unicorn jumped in the middle of the call center. Mounted on its back was a man of unimaginable beauty. Immaculate fair skin, rippling muscles and a confident smirk, Where no God came for me before, The Mittani (pbuh) came for me.

 

"Pick your god," Mittani (pbuh) said to the farmer girl, who was now a fiery skeleton. "Regret your choice."

 

The fiery skeleton shrieked in rage and dropped me to the floor. I watched as she lunged towards the beautiful warrior king, who cast her into the wall from the impact of a spinning jump kick. Impressively, as the fiery skeleton pulled herself from the wall we both witnessed that the Mittani (pbuh) hadn't stopped spinning. He spinned like the ancient Beyblade and delivered 666 roundhouse kicks in a span of 69 seconds, shattering every bone and smoldering the fire. The phantom menace was no more.

 

He held out His hand. "Come with me. This way."

 

The Mittani (pbuh) hoisted me up on the back of his unicorn and rode out of the office. I clung to his firm chest as the unicorn stretched out a set of rainbow-feathered wings and flew me into outer space. And this is how I became a Goon. This is why my character has only one eye.

I would be nominating my own posts in the EVE competition rather than wondering how everyone forgot "I was accused of being a TEST spy" in bewildered silence

I like this idea

fuck you

Little did these troglodytes, these sycophants, these slimy little pubbies know that I created an alt to join BRAVE, earned their trust in order to become a spy, infiltrated NCDot on another alt, and then blew up their supers. Thank you President Mittani (pbuh) for making all of this possible

I was fully expecting as the title and the first few seconds suggested that LussyLou took down Cormack's Titan with a Myrmidon, which I still believe he's fully capable of doing.

It is the most active PVP alliance in the game. Karmafleet is recruiting!

I thought everything and everyone had to be a part of some kind of business enterprise and that all the fighting had to do with that. I was expecting to just make a trade mining and hauling. I do it shitposting instead.

I'm taking a brief hiatus from EVE Online, but when I get back I'll probably re-involve myself in the Ministry of Love and CODE.

I can't post because nothing is going on.

"In order for there to be police, there needs to be pirates. We eliminated pirates long ago. In order to keep our jobs, we helped them come back."

Who was the first economy

Nobody hates anybody anymore, all wars HEAVILY favor the defender, and skill injectors removed a lot of gates from the most powerful ships.

You aren't the only one in fleet, you just were too busy jacking off to Overwatch hentai to listen to the FC when he told you to undock and warp to the outgate.

How much will it cost for a clip of blaster ammunition in Battlefront III?

Love you too!

The delusion is failing, the members have seen through the illusion of democracy. FCON is a lie, flee while you can! May they all one day find themselves in the loving embrace of the Mittani (pbuh) and nuzzle into His pectorals!

DOWN WITH DEMOCRACY!

The Mittani (pbuh) has spoken.

Stuntonia Keith, you have been found guilty of the high crime of toxicity towards Koahi, the Patron Saint of Cats. You have been thus stripped of your land and titles, and are cast out. Please never come back.

TEST, as punishment for your sins of Not Being Goons, we have kicked him your way. Have fun.

DOWN WITH DEMOCRACY!

I have never lied 

Pls add a skeleton race to your game and make solo PvP good

Hue Star Citizen

DOWN WITH DEMOCRACY!

Kendarr, you are my favorite FC. If I had to make a choice on who I would fly with if Fortress Delve came crashing down and all the FCs made a last stand, it would be you who I would choose first (Macko13 is a close second because he uses the word meme as a noun and a verb). But I can't stop.

Then why did she set those people on fire

Hilmar isn't as objectively beautiful as Seagull so I pretend he doesn't exist and that CCP Seagull is the CEO of CCP Games instead.

Do it

Hi Gihon!

It was a reference to Dust 514

Who else would it be

I didn't even know I wrote this. I kind of fell asleep and woke up and saw this.

hello? gihon?

NOT ENOUGH. THERE'S STILL SOME LEFT IN THE BOTTLE.

All I know is that's a big word and it was in the Bible a couple times.

No, I must have as much attention as humanly possible so this erection can finally last 4 or more hours.

DOWN WITH DEMOCRACY

The Mittani (pbuh) was out grocery shopping for Aryth as a personal favor, because the Lord of Fortune is going to upsell turkeys bought from Wal-Mart at the highly unionized Shop-Rite and use the profit to buy dragon dildos.

If it's any consolation, the beating I took for acting on my own accord was almost as severe as when I was accused of being a TEST spy.

DOWN WITH DEMOCRACY

No wonder they cancelled their SRP.

We're playing a video game about fictional spaceships headed by a company that seems desperate to find anything else other than this game to hold itself up, this is all a complete waste of time

I also have alcohol!

Poor TEST

Hail Satan!

You're summoning a demon too?

same

Much like CCP Games, I find that ignoring the lore helps.

You know, people like you are trying to help further a delusion and hurting these people's path to recovery. FCON needs rehabilitation. Democracy can be treated!

Mechwarrior Online > Bryci

thanks habibi

not very surprising, PL has bad spies

Congratulations! You lose!

His whole head is a mouth and it's conical so it's likely operating like a plunger. His mouth engorges a limb and then he just kinda sucks on it like a pacifier.

Also every important leader in EVE Online has a bendy straw.

take your time

I mean, you have one viewpoint. Your friends were tin foil as fuck from what I hear

If Suls got your friend kicked it was because he was likely an asshole

What is the problem with Boat aside from being wreckless

Have fun!

You don't need to have a Supercapital in Widot or am0k, it is preferred though. And in Widot we play Rocket League.

Karmafleet is recruiting newer players, for those more experienced I recommend Widot or am0k

It's not me. I'm waiting until we, through Fountain as our passage invade the broken and fractured North once more next Wednesday at 07:00 Eve Time to post about our triumphant return.

Karmafleet has garnered a promising recruit. May the glittering shine of the Mittani's (pbuh) smile dazzle his eyes.

Iunno, it's not like they're playing Destiny 2 anymore so they can't have anything better to do.

"Excellent."

A man swathed in black robes sneered at the carnage below. Destiny 2 PC was on fire. Bungie-jumping riot police dressed as Halo 2 jumped through the ceilings of PC gamers and snatched them from their keyboards. They bounced high into the air and were thrown into the helicopter blades. Their blood showered small suburban white neighborhoods like a torrential storm, with a backdrop of screams in thunder's stead. Few fought back, their gangly gamer arms unable to fend off the Halo cops. As the last one was swept into the air and tossed into the spinning blades of the helicopter blades, Peter Parsons removed the hood from his face and felt the warm drizzle of blood and gore.

"Some of you," he addressed his covert ops Halo police force over Teamspeak. "Are asking yourselves, 'what right do we have to condemn these gamers to die?' Well, gentlemen. Upon viewing.... **THIS!!"**

He held aloft a PC monitor with Destiny on a pause screen... with a STEAM OVERLAY. He heard the Halos gasping and shrieking in shock, some even vomiting at the sight. "You understand that you had no right to let them live. This was their punishment. This... was their Destiny."

#**DELETE THIS**

Iunno, why are you?

Mwahahahaha~

Calling you a willfully repugnant asshole isn't pushing my morals on you because I'm doing nothing to force you to change that behavior.

A social justice warrior is an inherently political pejorative. This isn't political, one. Second, criticizing you for being a willfully repugnant asshole isn't "pushing my morals on you," and it certainly doesn't make me a social justice warrior. You don't have to let the guy back in your alliance. He's better off being out of it.

Better than some amoral jackoff who apparently watched one too many Sargon of Akkad videos to start throwing around the SJW insult so freely. What's next, Grathy? A Pepe meme or a response video with the kekistan flag as the backdrop?

I'm not going to be an activist against your cretinous alliance who values killmails over corpmates, because your demeanor is enough of a deterrent.

Being offended by this doesn't necessarily require me being offended by everyone else. But I can say for a certainty that Sniggwaffe is run by a pack of repugnant low-lives lacking moral decency and the emulation of that behavior is encouraged at an alliance level so long as it furthers the goal of a shiny killboard. Whether or not you change is irrelevant to me, but it's worth making people aware of Pandemic Legion's moral bankruptcy so they don't make the mistake of joining or associating with your ilk.

Just because the world is full of assholes doesn't mean you're obligated to be one.

Difference is one person said "Yeah what I did was really shitty and over the line, and I'm going to apologize and attempt to make it right" and it's not you guys.

Mittens can get drunk and say something fucked up once and never hear the end of it even after apologizing and doing his best to make up for it. Even just a few months ago  as GigX threatened to track down and mutilate The Judge the Mittani's mistake done half a decade ago was still brought up as a counterpoint to CCP's decision. Yet you guys do something shitty like kick someone over a memorial roam because your killboard means more to you than someone's friend and suddenly the very idea a corp or alliance leader should be held accountable is ludicrous. You're dumb.

I too like to enable a corporation shitting itself at the prospect of someone going on a memorial roam for a dear friend because of their killboards.

inb4 "BUT THE MITTANI

IN A WIZARD'S HAT

AT FANFEST????"

this was more of an Eve is dead comment lol srry

My question to you is how can we have fake news when there isn't any news

That you know of. Why would the Hero of Asakai need to alert all of our footsoldiers to his doings?

Peace be upon him

penis

Who logs in anymore

WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB!

It stands for peace be upon him. Pious Muslims wouldn't merely call their main dude "The Prophet Muhammad," they say "Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wasallam," or Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him if they're not well versed in Arabic pronunciation. In writing, typing all that out is a pain so it's better to write out an abbreviation.

I just found "The Prophet Mittani (pbuh)" too amusing for what it's worth so now I just inject it all the time.

Sri Krishna would say otherwise

I have enough to spare!

we are what keeps the orbit around the sun. to create content is for mortals. it is clearly the will of mortals to live in deathly peace content to let the stars fall out of sight so long as they can remain unmolested.

bow before our abode of the universe

Jin'taan this is literally hate speech. We all came to your aid in the name of social justice when your anime came under attack, and now you use your Amarr privilege to spread this nasty racism on the internet? Sorry not sorry it's time to burn Providence.

will never not favor the redswarm national anthem but this is a good secondary patriotic hymn

now, with math!

pew pew

oh no i am dead

The reason why you don't have a good reddit narrative is because democracy is evil and the popular vote can't match the power of the Divine Imperium Spin.

Most of it on PLEX to continue the account and the rest of it on PVP.

I will pray that one day you too will find the Mittani (pbuh) in your life.

I just want a Bomberwaffe deployment
