You realize that some accounts get PAID to tag people in their posts right?

"20 DeviantArt points for a drawing? That's alright.

Now ... Try to convert 25$ into points ... That'd be 2000 points for a single drawing ?

"At school, I sell pictures that take me a hour to draw for only 25 cents. So all of this 'pay me for commissions' stuff is complete bullshit. And wouldnt people be reported for scamming like this?"

"I've seen people acting all high and mighty and charging from $15 to fucking ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS for their artwork. People don't have the money to pay upwards of 100 bucks for a freaking download or a piece of paper. Why not, I don't know, GET A JOB or something?"

"Sure, an artist has the right to charge for their skill. And I have the right to tell how fucking stupid that is."

"Do me a favor and just stop asking for money. God it's so hard to find good help these days."

"I am asking you to help me but you refuse for biased reasons. I'm asking for a little help from something you're good at but clearly are using for nothing. and fun fact, writers count as an artist to so maybe it's YOU who aren't viewing it from an artist POV."

"You want to get paid? Get a job near your house like I do. If you're not interested in helping me in the thing you're good at and 'loved' then you've never interested in it in the first place. You are GUILTY. I'm simply showing you."

"After 8 years of searching, I've learned most artists are only motivated by Money Fame and Power. I know for I've asked thousands to draw my hentai and most wouldn;t even try while less than 10 ever bothered to help me out of Generosity and Passion's."

"Could you at least try? I asked you to help me in something you good and skilled at, you gave up without even trying. I respect thosewho deserve it, who at least try. You didn't, you declined without even doing anything regarding my project."

"What's so wrong in helping someone? You said it yourself, it pays well being a freelance artist so why want more? Do you only enjoy showing your artwork for something so common as money? Draw my hentai."

"Like it or not, you've involved because you've make artwork's and posted it online. I'm having problem accepting declination to draw my hentai without proper reason, all you have are excuses rather than reasons."

"you have NO GOOD REASONS not to draw my hentai. I realize my way of dealing with artists is somewhat brutal and rude but it is the truth, if you wont help me just by me telling the truth then I have no regrets saying it, it just means I was right about you"

"You think it is disrespectful for me to ask you to work for free? Tell me 1 thing that no one has managed to answer so far, WHAT'S SO RESPECTFUL ABOUT NOT HELPING OTHER IN SOMETHING YOU'RE GOOD AT?"

"I have been searching for 8 years for someone to draw my hentai project. But everyone wants money. You want money? You can always go trying a thing called an 'Interview,' that's how most people get their jobs."

"Do you enjoy NOT helping people with the thing you're good and specialized at? You do not truly love drawing then, just the merit's it brought, Fame, Money and Power, right?"

"You want money? Simple. Get a job near you that isn't involving internet, you can still get paid for the things you do, just by other rules. I offered you something in return, publicity, the thing you need if you want to make it big."

"If you only draw what YOU want then I don't see the reason or why you posted your artworks online for everyone to see, unless of course, you want people to get jealous of you."

"I don't want to hear excuses like 'I only do commissions, not collaborations, because I need to pay my money/bills/etc.' If you say that I'm guessing you don't get out much, surely there a job vacancies around your area somewhere."

Me having these pictures does absolutely zero to hurt you. But everyone wants to feel superior about something so thank us in your memoirs for keeping you all so excited about things!

These people (especially that exposure account) act like you're stealing the bread out of their mouths when they're getting exactly as much support as they would be without this site being here for them to cry about.

Ryan, you cherry-picking fuck.

Pick out the worst of the worst takes so everyone can jerk each other off over how awful artists were treated today and a bunch of people who weren't going to pay you anyway suddenly continue to not pay you out of spite.

That's actually genius. Every $10 donated it is split between the thousands of artists on paytreon! This is a chance to teach "artists" about market saturation, while at the same time giving them exactly how much their "art" is worth (about a fraction of a penny to be exact).

Yeah sure, we're here because we're unwilling or unable to pay but want the goods.

But if this [patreon scraper] is actually massively hurting your profits when it's mostly people here that wouldn't be paying anyway? Then you should probably re-evaluate your model.

These people come here to preach about how [patreon scraping] is terrible because someone might see boobies for free that someone else paid for and that thought makes them sad.

If patreon worked like Netflix or Spotify where you pay like 10$ for all i don't think anone would mind, but it doesn't work like that. That's why people will always pirate it. The netflix model works so why can't it work for art too? Because artists are greedy fucks.

Like the RIAA and MPAA, you overvalue your content, expecting pay per view per month per person. [The Patreon Reward scraper] is like the netflix or spotify for art, distributing the cost amongst consumer who can't afford buying every song and video that ever released.

paywalling art is something wich completely negates the porpouse of patreon itself

If it wasn't for you bandwagoning on the anti-piracy hate train, people wouldn't bother giving you the time of day. Face it, you need people like us to be relevant. No piracy = no whiteknighting = no paytreon shekels oy ve

[re: patreon scraper]
most of us wouldn't be paying regardless for one reason or another. Maybe your prices are too steep?

If you're just gonna say "but no stop it ur bad" then you'd be better off not wasting the breath you take while typing it out.

You white knights mess it all up. This is exactly why we combat against new forms of paywalling.

Perhaps if you f*****s didn’t paywall is this wouldn’t happen.

Stop paywalling shit.

[re:stealing Patreon rewards]

When someone is horny and wants to fap one out to porn the volume tends to be turned down on the part of the brain responsible for moral evaluation. _You_ can draw moral lines but to expect it of others is probably unrealistic.

Most Patreons are porn and porn isn't art, so no it's not stealing art. And this site isn't the problem. It's a symptom of a bigger problem. If you expect people to draw moral lines when it comes to porn then you're living in a dream world.

I’m disgusted with greedy, third rate smut peddlers abusing patreon as a power grab for people’s wallets (and for patrons enabling this) They claim sites like this are stealing, but who’s the bigger thief, really? “Robin Hood” sites like this need to exist to even the score.

$40 is too much for a painting of Batman and the 4 Robins. Anything over $8 is too much.

building stuff inside a video game in my opinion is not a job.

Do you really think normal players that just want to enjoy their game care in what financial state creators are?

working for money is extremely hedonistic and selfish tbh

artists want to be paid.

sounds like communism to me and we all know how that turned out lol

[Bunny Charlie followup] https://t.co/uKOvY2dWHv

What kinda goddamn art is worth $100??? Legit anything above $50 is way overselling yourself and just makes you look vain as hell.

Stealing is such a wrong word to play here. Getting the work shared on my account only benefits the creator, no matter how you look at it.

I know that if the work [I repost uncredited] is good people will hunt for the creator.

I personally don't need to know who created the art I post. Your hate speech is childish and pointless.

People should educate themselves before making a public comment. Yeah, I'm such a leechy businessman, rar, you're right.

People say “you’re using malicious in the wrong way” and I’m not. I was targeted because of my position in the marketplace.

I feel like a politician now. This is kind of turning into a witch hunt to put me in a negative limelight.

many value pure experience more than monetary compensation. if ur not one then please keep your enlightened opinions for your little minds.

this world has myopic eye for learning &amp; working…burning lakhs in college instead of learning while working…distorted pre historic thinking…

I am not being arrogant, this is how creative people build careers. It's not that I can't pay but that should not be the motivation.

Many of you are willing to spend lakhs of rupees to get a degree, well this [working for me] is the old-fashioned way of doing it.

Pick your battles and move on. If someone uses a random pic? leave it.
otherwise you only make anger and cause damage to you &amp; other artists

And by the way, it is a lot of work to have an apprentice... it's not a one way street.

If I may give you some advice, I would recommend lowering the price a bit, since it is very high and probably nobody will buy it.

Quick question, would people care much about her art being stolen if she didn't mention her disease? Probably not.

It'll be a problem if people not doing their job
If one guy leaves most people will have to do overwork. It can possible be a chain reaction

We expect not many $ just a fun project.

Individuals who begin with and stay on as diligent-hardworking staffs receive exposures as much as possible.

Most of the risks come from the lack of guaranteed pay- which adds to the challenge

Making any sort of income with the completion and release of the game should be considered as a bonus if anything.

this project has no funding or expectation to create revenue so is completely risk free.
Main challenge'll be the amount of art it will take

No pay but we are paying the steam greenlight fee.

If you would like to help pay for the upload that would be much appreciated :)

[Replies to a Facebook post with screenshots of @forexposure_txt posts] https://t.co/OsZI6cvPlR

At this point in time, revenue will be discussed closer to release.

Risks: No money could potentially cause loss of motivation.

https://t.co/veHxUahIq7

https://t.co/CASj7ypZfO

If my team has the same enthusiasm as me, I like to think that the only risk is having too much damn fun!

Being a startup, we have no money to pay our employees, but we plan to Kickstart once we have a vertical slice.

At the moment I cannot offer any money, so we should work through dark cold days with no salary and make this game happen.

There are no revenue predictions, the only risks are wasting your and my time if at some point get bored or decide to quit.

The risk is the low revenue that we earn from the game.

But you won't know it until you don't try it :)

Team work makes the dream work!

there is not a Revenue from this project but we all will get extra experience and we will sure enjoy working together.

Risks? People leaving, not being serious enough, joking around.

And of course the risk of people loosing interest due to not being paid.

Free marketing is free, if you don't want it seen, don't share it in the first place imo.

How many money will you earn? That is not important... the important is that you will be known as a artists.

Everyone will HAVE to do at least a little of every ones work. No using excuses to do their work because the other work is not their thing.

what I'm  saying is people should think about these things. People need to understand the internet is a public domain.

Draw me something.
But I won't pay for it.

Pay?Just a damn excuse for making money. Did you know something called…JOB? Or borrow money and then return it when you can to your parents?

How may you benefit?
The answer to your questions is "Not yet."

This is not a single movie, it is a long term project

We have very little money to spare at present. Now let me tell you why this is a good thing for you.

From an okcupid match: https://t.co/qjStzFWdNL

Cartoon Comedy Writer
**THIS JOB DOES NOT PAY**
The reason being is that we aren't bringing anyone on full-time and we can't pay per joke.

We're not offering anything but experience (and MAYBE more work with some pay in the much later future IF you're needed)

You're a troll!
forexposure_txt is a troll!

I am not unable to offer payment at this time, however, if you want to find a project to occupy yourself with feel free to inquire more.

https://t.co/bVN2r6aXaw

A good price for art comissions is $10. It's gouging the art market, since the pros can't compete, but goddamn will you save some cash.

I don't think this is really necessary to say, but just for the record, to make matters explicit, you will not be paid.

I do not see "You don't offer a king's bounty" as constructive criticism, I'm sorry.

Unbelievable

I came here, a poor fucking sod living on damned scraps, seeking help. What did I get?

Fucking ridicule &amp; "pay me more, cunt"

Stop complaining about pay.
Such disrespect, stuck up, egoistic behaviour, i haven't yet encountered on any subreddit
Awful first experience

I spend $5000 commissioning art annually, id never give a single shekel to the petty crybully autist types that cry to @forexposure_txt

stop hardarming people who can't pay you the price you think is fair. It's a free internet.

I'm so sick of seeing artist like you only complain about being a artist if your just gonna complain get off your lazy ass and get a job

we are willing to accept part time commitment (~20 hours per week on average) until we have sufficient revenue to pay a salary.

Basement dwelling 'artists' are too butthurt nowadays

I know I shouldnt be a cunt 
but fuck me I hate this "hurdur dont share my art" sort of attitude

how do you know you're not getting anything in return if you didn't even do your part's yet?

I can't do art which is why I seek so many "Artist's" in hoping One would accept my Idea but they're nothing more than big talk's and Liar's

those who decline my collabs without reasonable Reason's

it's an Insult to a real Artist's who helped and being kind me

Why do I bother so many artist's?

well, I don't think many of them worth of calling an artist to be honest

Question's for self-proclaim Artist
Why be an Artist if you're not willing to Draw?
Why be MLP Fan if you're not following it's teaching's?

I'm very serious about this and I mean DEAD serious, you all have the option to end this, but you all still insisted on running away from me

I have ways of finding you, you all see me nothing more than a nuisances but will show you how serious I am then about this Collabs

I'll keep asking until I get what I want. Among many Clover's there's bound to be one 4 leafed clover

Draw my request
I'm not going anywhere until my goal is fulfilled
I still have some unfinished businesses here.

you just don't want to fulfilled my project
thus making it harder for both sides
you know full well how to stop me
its completing my project

who causes this hurt in the first place?
they're the one who's doing hurting by declining my Collab, do you have any Idea what it felt like?

Unser Projekt bietet KünstlerInnen die Möglichkeit, sich einem Publikum zu präsentieren –aber es ist eben kein Job, es geht um Straßenmusik.

I want you to do a request

decline its not a option

I give you Lesson In Life, Nothing it "FREE"
The moment you see my Story is the moment the option to decline drawing it is gone.

Apparently there's an account just for people that "steal" art and they expose them. Rip. I'll still just do what I want though.

Come on.
Just do the art.
Bronies and Pegasisters should help each other out.

Do art for me
THINK BLOCKING ME WILL CHANGE ANYTHING THINK AGAIN!!! as long as you're using the Internet I can/will/have ways of finding you

Block me to ignored my Existences?
Doesn't change anything
until you fulfilled my request you're still owe me
WHETHER THIS LIFETIME OR NEXT

Have faith we're trying to do right by our writers
We are
But if our effort to compensate becomes a source of grief we may have to cancel

Isnt it amazing an account of nobody deviantautists that complain about children wanting free shit has now open a patreon for their twitter

If blasting out a piece sounds like work, this might not be a good fit.

Please don't do this for money
Do this because you believe there's a better way to do journalism.
It takes about 20 minutes to write a piece

if you get interviewed, you cannot tell anyone anything you heard about in the interview, for if you do, we will sue you.

No need to be salty

I don't think this is really necessary to say, but just for the record, to make matters explicit, you will not be paid.

This is so cheeky i know, but is there any chance you are looking to work for free on video projects?

The grant I applied for the book only covered the writing. But the subject matter is important to you, isn’t it? Think of it as activism!

That's lame lol.
If you knew who I was n what I was boutta do to that shit.. you'd understand lol. Plus you'd get blessed but Ight.

Can you contrubute towards painting my food truck? I know alot of people so people threwout the valley will see your work for sure.

Want your song in a movie?
(this is not free)
We're asking for the right to use the song 1st, and asking for $5000 as well.

What am I offering?
i can get a key for the game if you would like that?
or normaly i'd support you with a post
pick what ever you like dude

we'd like to settle the basements first, once we get some funding we can start to talk about money.

This is not paid
we're just as broke as you.
NO greedy bullsh*t here.
This will require full dedication,
meaning droping college/work.

This does not mean I want cleavage.
I don't.
It's sad I have to even say it but again, way of the world and nature of Craigslist.

Need host for gardening videos.

You must be attractive.
Sorry, it's the way of the world.

Now I'm not talking Hooters attractive.

Being #TeamHuffPo gets me actual exposure. Funny folks are saying the only thing exposure gets you is sunburn and frostbite. You're funny.

Some things pay with money and others don’t.

via @bstals07 https://t.co/z3c4JfjLOg

When people see you speak up in Huffpo on a topic, giving them value, they value YOU. Value now = cash later, yes?

Mr Wheaton
if you're enterprising (see what I did there?) what you get from having articles appear in Huffpo can garner you cash beyond cash

THE CAREER OPPORTUNITY
Potentially receive exposure for your work across King Arthur: Legend of the Sword's digital and marketing channels.

I’m a staunch believer of working for free

@wilw is a staunch believer of not

So it would seem he and I now have become staunch opponents

If I was in it for the dough, I would go back to marketing and PR.

In the meantime, I’ll take all the exposure I can get.

Every time I fire a frame I am my most authentic self. Some of my most career defining moments paid zero cash dollars.

I don’t know about you, but I do what I do because I love it. No matter how big or small or what effect it has on my bank account.

Am I on crazy pills here or is @HuffingtonPost reposting something you already put out for free not the worst that can happen to an artist?

Work for free because practice makes perfect! What better way to push yourself than with a client who sort of has to give you that freedom?

Another reason to work for free:
You get to be a hero!
Adventure awaits with every yes. 
This I promise!

Don’t taxes suck? Totally.
One of the financial upsides to working for free is the tax write off. This includes stuff like hard drive space.

Every time you work, whether paid or not, you just added a reference to your rolodex and resume. That’s just psychology and math and stuff.

Of my overall business 80% percent is referral. And I promise you, the ones I donated my services to are sometimes the first to recommend me

Response after being called out for stealing an image from @Savescreen https://t.co/FrWQB7BiOC

One way or another exposure will cost you. How the hell is anyone supposed to find you if they don’t know you exist? We are not all @wilw

Working for free is no different than sending out press releases or buying advertising space or hiring an agent. You’re paying for exposure.

Just like life, find a healthy balance of not whoring yourself out but accepting opportunities that will give you reasonable exposure.

There's an old artist saying:
"You can die from exposure"
I hate that line.
I hate it because you can also wither and die from lack of it.

Many people think "working for exposure equals selling out." Which unless you are @wilw is not the case at all.

Exposure and advertising are the same thing. It just depends on how you look at it.

I am looking for interns. You will be watching my gear hold gear and anything i ask. You will learn a heck alot of photography from me.

https://t.co/F2rLNqCi75

Get a better job. I mean, u just did a drawing I couldve done, u expect me to pay wtf

Please don't waste my time if you don't have any connections...

I have a youtube channel, with the proper exposure it could be worth millions of dollars a year. Here is a video (54 views)

If I did have money I wouldn't have an ad like this. I would hire some PR professional and that would be that.

I have NO money... I say it again, NO money.

I have NO money. I am offering you to be FREE of corporate america, being chained to a desk, living pay check to pay check.

The person who helps me get this exposure will be a CELEBRITY in the after life (you will understand that when we meet)

We do charge a fee of $25 to be featured on this album, but we guarantee the exposure.

you never worked for free at some point?
My career path had me paying to work.

I interned for a year for free, as did most of my peers.
Don't act like this isn't common.
Some people hustle. Some whine on twitter.

if you don't work for free, you often can never prove value to the most important people.

You have to prove value more than ever. Foot in the door often comes by working for free.

Fastest way to a job today is to provide a team, a player, an agency, great work unsolicited and for free. Great way to be noticed.

Giving something away for free, working for free at some point as you try to make it in the industry, is some of the strongest advice I got.

No pay, but you will get writer credit on a project that actually gets made at no cost to you.

It will be unpaid but we will eventually hire someone for this position.

Thanks.

i'm an icon.

lmaoooo bro you can say im corny for stealing art you have that right you also have the right to run up on me and get blown the fuck away

if the people I’m stealing from make a living from their art maybe they should have multiple streams of income.

Why not get money from the government and work an actual job when you arent doing the thing you do for free?

Honestly I think expecting compensation is insulting to art as a form of human expression.

Producing art, and that art being consumed by the world is a reward in and of itself.

Being an artist to make money, going out of your way to milk as much money as you possibly can from it is a shitty life philosophy.

Stop doing it if it isn't for the love of it cause clearly you aren't making money and complaining only makes your life harder.
No one cares

I just see so many artists whinning about exposure. It is a means to an end. You do things to be noticed, you work starts to have value.

https://t.co/ZL5vqzkS3O

Someone with a pen and camera without value shouldn't be turned off by the word "exposure".

Im saying pay your exposure dues before you can grumble with entitlement. Long time artists can be entitled.

People I said "exposure" not first born child and then all your appendages. Seriously. Entitlement here. It is thick!!

Perhaps exposure gives your art value? Tell Me more about how no one will pay your insane prices for something without value. :)

Stop holding the hands of artists whom haven't made it past the exposure stage.

if you don't like the life where you are doing what you love but it doesn't pay the bills, then don't become an artist.

I'm a regular 23y/o &amp; not a crazy craigslister.
If you're open to cutting or coloring your hair that would also be a perk but not necessary.

Update: I've found an artist, but I would still like anyone interested to read on and contact me for the sake of a backup

I also do not want any manga artist!

I don't really wanna put too much on here but the title of it is called "Dark Kingdoms" I have the name for the kingdoms and everything.

i do it only as a hobby, and if you are doing these stuff for money go find another post.

I can't pay you unless we makle money,
If we do, you get however much you want.

To put it simply,
if no income is coming in ,
then money won't be handed out.

I am unable to pay as I am not in a position to do so, therefore someone who would be happy to work for free would be preferable.

Hey what's up we found someone to do it for non profit, we have a tight budget but if your willing to compromise let's work.

The workload can be arranged to ensure not to disturb your own other daily activities.

if you're looking to build up your 'street cred' so to speak in comic book art, this may be the project for you.

I can settle with hand-drawn work, but I would prefer someone who knows there way around any manga software.

I need help in making my idea into a story like I have the idea but unfortunately I can't properly write it so I need a writer and artists.

it can be a comic or novel but I think a novel will be quicker but if majority wants it as a comic then comic it'll be demorcracy!

My previous commissions came from https://t.co/9qBxkJdaW0, so yo can see I don't have much buget yet.

https://t.co/8lMmqVJjla

I'm sure it would be as enjoyable to draw as it was for me to write.
There could easily be 300 chapters worth of material.

While we aren't offering money, this is a great opportunity 😉

We cannot pay you money, but your graphics will be shown to (hopefully) thousands of [paying] players around the world!

Colaborate with me.
After 3 months of really getting into art (no lessons) I've come to the conclusion I cannot draw to the standard I need.

Artist Wanted

FOR THE RECORD IT'S NOT COMISSIONED WORK!

Calling this "unpaid" because we may not make any significant gain at all. It's either we all get a piece of the payload or we don't.

I suck at art.
I need an artist.
As for payment,
I can't pay you

Pf course money will be split but the question regarding how much profit will actually be made remains unanswered. Do not expect to be paid.

I'm not gonna pay someone who is my equal.

No pay; just the satisfaction of teamwork with me

We would make the first chapter or so and then submit it to Image Comics for distribution and of course, the money to continue working on it

I am an ambitious writer, but csn realize what's reality and what's not, meaning, we both have to be realistic.  I'm sorry I cannot pay you.

While I'd like to say that I'll pay you whatever you want, I can't. I just got a new job after months of unemployment so I'm short on cash.

Although it is unpaid, If it works out I do plan on publishing.
Yes this would take time as it is a lengthy storyline, but I'm in no rush

I'd love to inform you more on the story, but i'd rather keep it instilled till I have someones commitment

No pay.

I can't pay you with money I don't have

It is simply a painting project I will be handing in and receiving back. For those who are going to judge, please don't bother responding.

To be clear, I will be passing this off as my own for my professor but it will NOT be displayed anywhere for any reason.

Currently, we can't afford to pay people; however, we are almost done with a few projects and will hopefully earn money

this is an indie film, and unfortunately we have exceeded our budget with production and editing. We can buy you a metro card.

if you're looking to build up your 'street cred' so to speak in comic book art, this may be the project for you.

we have very high hopes and outstanding determination to be the "Top Dog."

There is no payment because, obviously, we can't afford to pay anybody since we haven't done anything.

Every artist wants to be paid, though I really cant pay you but if you have good art I think we can pull this through, well that means money

https://t.co/JOKSmFjeAf

I cant pay you, I am already 20 years old and already finished college.

Plz if you've gotta a dream , a plan pm me , if i don't answer then I'm afraid it's me not you .

This is an UNPAID opprotunity and we cannot compensate monetarily. We are happy to negotiate other forms of compensations i.e. lunch

I know it may sound unfair and silly to ask for an artist to work for free but truth be told I've got a story that I've worked so hard on

This requires 10 hours per week and is unpaid.
In return, we'll provide you with a kickin' reference letter and invaluable insight!

An americano, or maybe a cappuccino if it's before lunch.

I offer no financial incentive, experience, high fives, or promises of future paid work. I might buy you a coffee, but nothing fancy.

I have no plan for this to become a popular manga
I would pay if i could
but i couldn't
i'm still hoping there are people to do it for free

I know you're a professional, but...
can you do something... less,
something not as good?

https://t.co/aI18e5xCEw

As for drawing it my self.
It would take more than 5 years, roughly and to be honest, I don't really enjoy drawing.
At all.

The mangaka artist would need to meet the following requirements:
-Has enough free time to take on a full-on project.

It'll be a full-on project so yes, I am aware, it is quite a request... but, I have a lot of confidence.

Been looking for a Mangaka all over my city for a while. Haven't really come to any conclusions so I decided I might just take it to the web

It would not be a paid opportunity due to our budget but on the long days on the set we always get pizza or something.

I prefer good amateurs who have the talent to break into the industry.

Non-Paid artists wanted.
I would like to think this would be my paycheck manga story so i can work on my serious projects.

as soon as a get an artist, I can start working with him, and start this legend of mine.

We have no budget so we'd be looking for this for free.
But if you did this, there'd be 5 more bookings for you!
They'd be for free as well.

a lot of the posters on here only seem to care about moneh .. its a bit of a den of "entitlement".

Once this manga comes, It can become one of the tops.

Need musician to collaborate on "Tea Party Music" that will persist for some time even generations.

Does anyone have a funny idea floating around their head? 
Anything.
I'll credit you as the writer too.
I'm not picky, so any idea will do.

I upload my videos on Youtube, some of them are good but I'm suffering from writers block so it's extremely hard to think of a good idea.

I wanna band to make a few tracks as quickly as possible.
nobody is doing it and i'm surprised.
Let's make it and get it er done.

All I can offer is crediting your work, not that you need it.

If it'll be animated ,I need an animator. If it'll be a webcomic, I'll just need artists. Either way, I'll need someone pretty good.

This creation is either going to be a webcomic (Example: Homestuck) or an animated series (Example: Eddsworld), I haven't decided yet.

I edited out your ugly signature https://t.co/KApRJJX4iR

I’m guaranteeing Huge CREDITS to you :)

I'm looking for a group of people to collaborate with on a series. Details about the series will be sent once I find people to work with.

Searching of someone who can give me some of his free time…not very complicated but needs to be done by someone who knows what he is doing

I'd be an honor for someone to help seeing as currently, we have great character designs but sucky music.

I can't pay any money seeing as
A. The project is quite small and
B. I have yet to receive any crowd funding on my patron.
&lt;link to Patreon&gt;

the offer is that once you have finished your story you will receive credit for your work

I love your books, but had to return them as they were too expensive. I'd appreciate it if you could make your books free from this point on

deadlines are 2 weeks, the I have plans for printing and I'm playing producer and cordnator. So are you in?

The plan for marketing is that I will get this comic book in a popular comic book store and put up flyers

Could it be that receiving unpaid gigs is confirmation of a lack of value, rather than ignorant, piss-taking numpties?

If one finds one is being asked to work for free more often than not, is it possible one's service/product isn't good enough?

UPDATE: Sold for $10,000 at auction.

Available at auction. https://t.co/PwXClDqRuM

Not everyone is looking for money.

Why would you turn down free advertising? You need to remember that you are amateur, very amateur. Why would we want your images?

I'm not a person comfortable with someone working for me for free. I can't offer pay but I can offer something maybe more valuable-knowledge

Free photographer wanted.
An expensive cake is being made up. https://t.co/5gRvWbB0vL

Apparently people can even "burn out" working to hard to make...
video games.... https://t.co/w6g3bQKtE8

If working on a game for 80 hours a week for months at a time seems “strenuous” to you … practice more until you’re better at it.

There’s nothing that can compensate people “fairly” for the sacrifices that great art requires.

Making games is not a job,
pushing a mouse is not a hardship.

It’s art. You need to get an actual job producing productivity software if you want to be paid “fairly” and go home at 5 p.m.

You would think they are trapped in some disenfranchised third-world country forced to dig blood diamonds https://t.co/sJikL9UkBQ

I can’t begin to imagine how sheltered the lives of modern technology employees must be https://t.co/ykIflYRrSV

Game developers must avoid the ‘wage-slave’ attitude https://t.co/Ur2Bl64fv0

I do not know why and how did my brain could came with this idea, and surprisingly!, I experienced it in my own dream during my naptime.

I need an artist who is willing to go 50/50 in building the product.
If it fails, well - that's life.

If you are so brilliant and precious about your value then why are you looking on a Facebook site for work?

It's not a troll. I'm serious...
I want people to make a game for me... https://t.co/o5IdU7YSdH

No doubt it's different in your country but you cannot dictate what people do over here I'm afraid! Didn't you know that before you came?

Sad that people work for free? I resent your comments which challenge a British democratic value of freedom to make your own choices.

I want someone who is actually trying to make fucking comics and not hungup on the idea of making comics.

What do you gain if you are not paid by us?
Do you want to feel fulfillment?
We are a team, not a unit
We treat each other like best friends

I have no cash for you,
do not message me about money.
I'm not trying to sound like an asshole,
I just don't want you to waste my time.

I want most likely male artists
(and Adult for legal reasons)
Someone who can send at least 1-3 pages a week.
No excuses, no procrastination

I know that art supplies cost money and so does writing supplies. Sometimes you lose on both end.

I just don't understand why two people can't get together and make some comics to expand portfolios on both ends.

animation colabaration
(its not paid)
you dont have to be good or anything
just passiont about it!!!

I want to make an animated series.
Animator wanted.
We would split the profits 50/50.
The style needs to be similar to Over The Garden Wall.

Look at some of the current successful artists, they went years without making profit off their work.
They just did it because they loved it

You will NOT be compensated, but if you do exceptionally well I will take care of you. Send FULL BODY Photo. https://t.co/tYpx3FNwln

I forgot to mention.
Unfortunately I cannot afford to pay.
I hadn't really considered it.

The genera I was looking to make a story in was the superhero genera, but I am open to most any other genera.

Need a camera. If you want to op the camera for the video since we don't have insurance, that's fine too.

This is a collaboration versus compensation.

Instagram Foot Models Needed.
Looking to promote Instagram users through my own Instagram account.
Perfect for gaining exposure!
No pay.

I'm not an editor for a publishing house or anything. This shouldn't be as hard to do as others are making out. It's actually simple.

This isn't a comic for Marvel or DC. It seems like everyone wants to be paid out of the gate for small amateur projects.

Writers should not expect to be paid. However, if there is a surplus in funds what is done with that money will be decided on by the editor.

J'vois pas l'mal,graphiste ça mérite pas forcément un salaire puisque que c'est pas très dur ^^

I hope you’re real proud of taking my hard earned money for a photo. One of my friends is a photographer and he found it laughable.

pay is not the case here.
I'm looking for talent that wants to show what their made of.
iam trying my best to make kool shit.

I've worked on this for over 10 years and will continue for at least another 10. Please be willing to begin a long-term partnership.

With luck, the artists who I partner with may begin a professional career!

"Must Offer Corporate-Style Pay Or I Will Cast Aspersions On Your Reputation So No One Works With You" is not exactly a welcoming stance.

Why don't I use Kickstarter to get a budget to pay artists?
Kickstarter's for the self-published. I'm not.

Maybe you’re right &amp; my expertise is not worth a mini-comic. I’ll just tell the untrained to get an MFA and come back to me with a portfolio

Instead of flat-out rejecting the untrained, my current offer is a reasonable quid-pro-quo compromise for me.

Pay is no guarantee for a mercenary contract-breaker to stick around.

&lt;examples of training&gt;
I had to spend 8 hours finding reference for him as he'd never had gay sex in real life.

Since mercenary disloyalty seems to be a thing you artists spend time developing, I now offer training in exchange for work instead of pay.

Happy to train new homoerotic comics artists in exchange for art for a mini-comic I can sell.

Don't you pay to go to college to work with masters?
You're paying with 8-pages of work with what you'd be paying for with student loans.

We already spent enough on the videographer.

No vendors eating at bride request (sorry about that) but you can get a spot for $150. https://t.co/82NJ1GJFAD

THIS WILL TURN OUT TO BE PROFITABLE &amp; VALUABLE.
If anything you will get exposure.

Writer Seeks Artist / Best Friend.
I can't offer a page rate at this time.

The thing I can truly offer you, and it won't be worth jack shit to you probably... I'm not looking for a freelancer. I want a co-creator.

compensation: notoriety https://t.co/EeAEdtSs9H

HOW MUCH DO I PAY?!?
You want from me to be honest?
Almost nothing.
That's how it goes when you're a 18-year-old with barely any lunch money

I know I'm pretty unrealistic right now and that nobody will contact an unexperienced brat. This is a desperate move. But it's worth a shot.

This is maybe pathetic, but I need an artist.
I'm too lazy to draw my own things.
I don't even have the guts to do it.
It's too much for me.

if does happen to blossom into a masterpiece and gain commercial success, the artist will undoubtedly become part of the credited developers

we are unable to compensate an artist at this time, this is an INDIE game so we ourselves haven't even been allotted a budget.

I've had an idea for the political pizza parody of our times. Although there's no money involved there is the possibility of pizza.

Poster submissions must include the $25/entry fee or they will face disqualification.

You will be a swiss-army knife of creativity. You may be the first person to see a project. Or maybe you come up with the idea yourself.

WHAT I'M OFFERING:
A great learning experience.
I'm a "hugger" &amp; and that ethos expands to everything I do.
I'm not secretive.

WHAT I'M OFFERING:
Exposure to every part of the business you may want to know about... and also those you don't.

…well i work a shitty day job and i'm broke, so if you think your going to pay your rent making animations, well good luck with that.

every time i post an ad like this i get shit from people who think its absurd to ask someone to make art without paying them...

it's important to rene ber that art is not about credits, money or likes...

it's on google images lmfao literally anyone can get the picture, go cry to your mum or something

I'm pretty sure I can use any photo that was willingly put onto the Internet to post in an album if I like it.

so You Are saying we should always post pictures that we took?
so you never posted a photo that was on Google or somewhere?
-.-

What if the person who invented the wheel said no one can use it ?
What would we be doing now ?
(No offence it's only a constatation)

You're bitching about Harry posting your work, yet the photo is accessible on google?
Do you plan on suing everybody?
Seriously?!

Shut your fucking mouth and be grateful that he posted your fucking photo yo looser.

Everybody is always taking photos of other people, just because it's HARRY STYLES everyone become so bitchy, remember where your place is

That guy who took your picture is Harry styles and even his bum is more famous and smarter than you.

Harry didn't mention your name but if you take a screen of his post and search it on Google, you find your name.
Attention-seeker much?

wtf man, what's the wrong thing in posting a pic without credits? I beat the 750.000 persons who liked don't even know you or even your work

I wouldn't even know about the photo if harry styles hadn't posted it. He helped you, jerk.

It’s completely standard for someone with a career like mine to have researchers and assistants and ghostwriters. A mix of paid and unpaid.

It looks like you just want money...
harry styles is so nice and you an ugly person who makes this a big deal because of money...

It's on Google for everyone else to use. So why make a big deal over this, I feel bad for Harry lmao.

Are you fucking jealous he could reach 500k likes with your pic? It's just a photo, get over it, be a grown up man.

you need to be happy that harry styles posted your picture. If he didn't, just ur grandma saw it. Stupid dumbass.

How smart of you not to put a watermark on it and then get mad when people use your pictures.

YOU ARE SUCH AN IDIOT!! Who the hell cares about the photographers of the photos you post on instagram?

Idiot, you are saying that harry styles have to take permission to an annoying photographer to post a fuckin picture on instagram?!!!!

We're not fund-holding entities, so this is not a commercial opportunity for the artist. The copyright must remain with us for the lifetime.

If a client want something, we want someone invested enough to stay extra hours to finish out of passion, not necessarily for financial gain

Collaboration and art is a payment in itself

We want a guy,
because let's face it -
this is the real world.

Im not looking after the biggest talen on earth.. just someone who finde this an oportunity to develop his/her owns skills

I want someone available to collaborate on a long period of time. The most of the stroy is sattle but new ideeas are welcome.

I love to create sotrys.
I'm looking for a new friend.
A hard-working artis who's serious.
I just woke up to transfor my stroys into a manga

What's in it for you:
Unfortunately, not money.

I would like to make a video comic.
I know that that might not even be a thing, but we can make it one!
(before anyone needs to ask, unpaid)

I am starting a project for a class and I think it would be cool to get this community involved.

I am sorry I cannot just pay everyone.

No payment will be made to the performers
but a cream tea will be provided for musicians.

An audience is not guaranteed.

So, does there happen to be an artist floating around?
This is our dream, and I promise we won't actually waste your time.

Basically, a Mother inspired rhythm RPG is what we want, and it's what we will have if we can actually find someone who can do the art.

What’s in it for you
-Critique on your work from people who truly care about how it turns out.

it's not a paid position!

...and it makes me not want to consider your services when I can increase my budget.

when people whine, complain and accuse me of disrespecting the art profession Im going to get really annoyed...

*AND IF YOU DO VIOLATE MY OVER $20 RULE NOT ONLY YOU WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED YOU WILL BE BLOCKED AND REPORTED FOR SPAM*

*I CAN NOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. I WILL NOT CONSIDER ANYONE WHO CHARGES MORE THAN $20 FOR ANYTHING*

As Dragonball Z is a copyrighted franchise, the only recompense I can offer is a part of any donations I may get.

I hope no 'know-it-alls' start 'telling me how it's supposed to be' and how 'I shouldn't be asking in here, unless I'm going to pay someone'

if enough people agree, well start making actual progress. if we cant build up steam its not gonna happen.

It probably wont go anywhere. Don't get me wrong about my intentions, we really want this to work. we just cant do anything.

I would like to create a game. But my team has no skills, talent or programming abilty. But we KNOW what we need in depth.

Who knows, maybe one day the game will blow up and make money, but at least we finally made something and can have satisfaction from that.

If you're looking for a quick buck or something to slap onto a resume, this job is not for you.

Applicants interested must have the passion for doing what they do, that transcends mere money.

We need a full time person to film practice. I think we could offer a team t-shirt. Need a person 100% committed to attending ALL practices.

Please be SERIOUS. Do not waste our time.

i need an assistant to hang out with me &amp; document the cool performance art shit i'm doing on a day to day basis. compensation: clothes

Now, if you're skeptical, it's okay, this isn't a paid gig or a grand idea, but rather a starting point.

You will use your skills to do the assignments given to you.
We want you to be efficient with your time and do the given assignments on time

You are expected to have all the tools you need to create the art.
I am working on this 10 hours a week and expect you do the same.

The cut is 50/50 after expenses. I can't do sound so the closer we get to the end we will have to put some money up front to hire someone.

I'm working on a Doom inspired comic for my dad's birthday. Would some kind soul be willing to help me? Of course you'd get credit.

Looking for comic artists!
The franchise will go on for hopefully ever.
Must be devoted.
That is the key to success,
especially nonprofit

I want someone for a long-term project.
(Not someone who will do one page and fucking quit)
Someone who can follow fucking directions.

I want someone who doesn't draw fucking stick figures.
(If you're iffy about your talent, then yeah, most likely you fucking suck.)

Please don't go thinking that I'm exploiting myself at my age.
I wouldn't have exploited myself, even when I was at an exploitable age.

I may just hire all the equipment myself,
and do it all myself.
All for free. How would that be?
Would that be okay?

Lots of TV production courses don't necessarily teach this stuff so learning on the job is really important.

I don't see what the big problem is here.
When I was a film &amp; TV student I got involved in lots of freebie jobs.
I loved 'em

There is an old saying:
Set a sprat to catch a mackerel.

Nothing wrong with a bit of unpaid work that might just put you on track.

'love don't pay the bills'
What a work ethic to give young people.

If everyone's taking the attitude that 'love don't pay the bills' then we are far more f@*ed than I thought.

Sometimes a person has to invest in their future.
I do loads of work for free.
For who's "Benefit" not mine
I see only good coming from this

Look I know working for free isn't popular
but it's a freakin' good opportunity.
I cannot believe you people.

You're asked to do loads of work at college and have to pay to be there. Plus your work only gets seen by the teacher and maybe mum and dad!

Jesus, seriously?
exposure is half the battle.
It can lead to wonderful things,
many of which have nothing to do with a payday.

I fully realise that the arts are hurting but this is like a lynch mob.

I WILL NOT BE GETTING PAID for getting the bands to turn up, and bands are only too happy to drive to the venue for FREE and play their set.

There are many youngsters who can see the value of getting involved in a nascent project
exploit is your word;
Maybe they don't need a nanny

It's a request;
its up to them.
What they ain't got a mind if their own?
Sheesh.
Its up to them.
Out of order.
Yourself.

Money later.
Maybe!
Nothing ventured nothing gained.
Sounds like a way to make a name for yourself?
You bet.
