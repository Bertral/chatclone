back in the early 90s when i was in high school i'd call republicans fasicts to their faces and while this at the time felt radical (but i was a lolbert lawl) nowadays it's a pedestrian statement of fact, here's a fascinating half-hour discussion about usa genocide on the border https://t.co/c1BNK0boYK

@Krosskeyz I had no idea - never even heard of it, that's awesome. 

I should stick to pants~

@ryangrim It’s the Confederacy, it’s always the Confederacy~

@Mynas Compared to their recent track record with falsely accusing Brisc of bullshit, the skillpoint sales plan that backfired, and the drifter stuff touching the third rail in null I want to give them a gold star and a hug for the rollout on this one, heh. The bar is... yeah. low.

@Mynas I think it's reasonable to test first to see if the baseline of no local is feasible before investing dev resources for a recon feature that might be a boondoggle - if they go no local and everything grinds to a halt, even recon structures won't help.

Also consider that unlike with the Drifter idiocy, CCP has discussed local and intel/recon improvements for years with the CSM, they gave proper notice in the devblog and have made it clear they may roll it back if it doesn’t work - that’s mature and reasonable corporate comms.

I’m a fan of no local in null, especially if they add observatories/sensor networks structures, and novel ways to counter/disrupt those nets. Free recon data, be it sov timers or the MER, cut down a vibrant part of the scouting and espionage meta. #tweetfleet #eveonline

Oops. https://t.co/HW3O65l27F #tweetfleet #eveonline

@Devilishlydo ah, that makes more sense

also the Rumsfeldian Unknowns was one of my wake up calls that corp media was dumb as fuck, Rumsfeld might have been a shitbag but the whole 'unknown unknowns vs known unknowns' is one of the most useful pieces of strategic logic, and idiot dc flaks mocked it as being dumb? vOv

A fantastic compilation of information on the Drifter event from @TMCArrendis: https://t.co/pVSBLXVW37 #tweetfleet #eveonline

@shadowclasper Also different thread as I fucked off to the UK, but I’m not sold on the refugee culture vs native culture distinction, I’m afraid it’s overbroad - the Albion’s Seed stuff provides a useful lens because it’s particular to specific cultures and their context.

@shadowclasper We’re interpreting it primarily as a business disaster for CCP, heh. Same shit, different decade - half the time instead of fighting each other we have to fight the company to prevent them from ruining the sandbox. The reddit rage is entertaining, at least~

It’s the Confederacy; your daily dose of white supremacist shitbaggery. https://t.co/cp5AwwbYcW

Marianne Williamson has, in one debate, made the @MikeGravel teens a sensible, establishment team of operatives - perhaps a little edgy but yes, those are the teens running a campaign. But the crystal magic Oprah powers lady, wow - just wow.

@RYP__ hey now :(((

lotta babbys writing fanfic here hoping an npc could accomplish for them what they couldn’t themselves and burn down the Imperium

unfortunately for you boys the killboards don’t lie and the npcs have been handled since the first day, bet your lil fantasy land feels good though~

@KatanaSeiko Oooh, neat - thanks for linking me this.

@PelegaPlays i don't think i've made a secret about being angry that a spacewar which was about to go into the drone regions being interrupted by a wow raid angers me? like yeah i'm mad about it, duh vOv

@PelegaPlays there's gonna be a bunch of pubbies who don't know how to look at killboards and jacking off to the fantasy that imperium space is being purged, and you're the first idiot to that plate, congrats you get a sticker~

this mary sue pve bullshit can eat my ass and the fact that for the first time in the game's history actual PvP warfare was interrupted by a glorified world event is pathetic but w/e it'll take a few days for pubbies to realize we haven't lost shit from it(not the official quote)

@RYP__ Obligatory "It's the Confederacy" post of the day

@QasimRashid It’s the (neo)Confederacy~

@Feiryred Probably should have clarified, I meant Civil War re-enactments. And my god do the interviews get awkward when a reporter asks one of the CSA re-enactors why they fight and there’s a lot of stammering and some crap about states rights, heh

as much as i leftypost criticizing the neoconfederacy i cannot survive long without a supply of fried chicken or bbq without absolutely flipping my shit johnny mnemonic style

the first thing i ate (sought out with urgency, too) when i got back to the states was popeye's drowned in hot sauce and man as much as i loved the uk trip i can't believe they haven't discovered fried chicken yet? fish and chips are so damn bland compared to soul food

which is not to nerd shame re-enactors, I’m watching a video of one right now in fact and it looks like hilarious fun

really late to this take I’m sure but wow  reenactments are just larps for republicans aren’t they

@elonmusk @KyleKulinski @DatKlow what

Confederate support for camps goes all the way back to Andersonville. Those old photos are awfully familiar; that is where the Very Fine People of the Lost Cause seek to return us today. 

Don’t get your US history from Ken Burns, for fuck’s sake.

@laura_hudson basically my week over here, yeah

More real analysis, another excellent thread. https://t.co/hkp2RwBLIO

@Mynxee you could have simply asked~

@helo0428 They’re all societies smaller than Dunbar’s number, so the structure and behavior is radically different and less institution-based.

Needless to say I’m absolutely delighted with the CSM election results; thanks to all of our citizens who voted the way the State asked~ #tweetfleet #eveonline

@elivalley It’s the Confederacy, etc etc~

@Cincinnatus358 Imagine not having seen the news yet and expressing the entirely legit confusion about why I mentioned Carlson, then finding out what happened. You’re in for a mindfuck, my dude. :/

A good thread cataloging various MENA ops relevant to this whole shitshow. https://t.co/mjmEdObKz9

@ladyattis Like, we already know what it looks like when a hegemon just says ‘fuck it’ and leaves power vacuums and talentless hacks in charge of the decolonization process, and ugh

@ladyattis Which is why if you do have an empire, and you desire to scale it back or wind down the whole imperialism thing, it’s so horrifically complex a problem that you’d want the most talented people you have available working on that problem so it doesn’t send everything spiraling :/

@noizygamer I’m still mad as fuck about the politicization of the IC. 

(Yes, empire is inherently political, I’m saying ‘polticalization’ in the DC meaning of the word, caveats go here, you guys know what I mean)

I could probably rant about this all day but people don’t seem to realize that we almost started the third world war out of raw blind idiocy 48 hrs ago and may have been momentarily spared only because of Tucker Fucking Carlson.

And it’s that foreign service and intel apparatus that you use to maintain the empire after a conquest, having the best military the world has ever seen doesn’t help you maintain your hegemony after the battle is over. Warriors aren’t (usually) spooks, diplos, or policy wonks.

Our actual military continues to get ever better as those talent funnels are probably the best in the history of the world, but State has been gutted and god knows what’s happened to recruiting and management in the 3-letters.

just imagine for a moment that it was so bad in 05 that this tier of talentless hack got where he did, and it’s probably gotten worse in the last decade https://t.co/psbCosbYjr

I mean fuck, these jokers can’t even manufacture consent properly, and that’s empire 101.

Anyway back from a lefty perspective, morally speaking empires are bad.

Amorally speaking, please stop fucking up the basics because again, brick in a dryer situation when a carefully built up empire lets the also-rans with chips on their shoulders in the civil service/IC.

Remember that to get a real clearance in tyool2019 you can’t even smoke weed, which instantly removes a tremendous proportion of the top talent from Gen X onward, plus the garbage salaries and dumbass political appointees cocking things up.

*both shit at home and abroad, stupid autocorrect

Basically don’t let idiots who think their penis size is directly proportional to the budget of their SCIF get near real power or you risk Cannae-ing the whole thing, with very bad consequences because while the talent pool has degraded, our kinetics have not

Anyway if you conquer most of the world with your best and brightest, you can’t maintain that heg by letting shit-tier jokers like Pompeo or Bolton near the levers of power created by their more talented predecessors generations ago.

One of the shit consequences of the financialization of the US economy (as well as the simultaneous ascendency as law as a profit center and handmaiden of that financialization) is that the talented and ambitious types who would aim for the foreign service/IC go for GS or Skadden

Given the horrific complexity of managing an empire, you absolutely must have your best and brightest talents in the foreign service, military and intelligence apparatus. Speaking here in terms of amoral realpolitik, obv.

What seems clear is that imperialism done stupidly is vastly more destructive to life and the planet that imperialism done effectively, once you’ve made the (immoral, bad) choice to seek hegemony.

Oversimplifying greatly, as an empire you have the questions of how you treat other states and questions of how you treat your own citizenry; you can have a vicious empire which treats its citizens well in addition to the more stereotypical born-shit-at-home-and-abroad situation.

I’m against imperialism, but since it’s all we play at in certain spaceship video games, I find myself torn between condemning it vs screaming ‘holy fuck you’re doing it wrong’ when I see it getting cocked up so amateurishly.

@GoonWave That would entirely defeat the purpose ;p

@Frabba The Pax Americana itself is at risk with more fuckups like the Guaido thing, and shit will spiral out of control like a brick in a dryer across multiple theatres if we get into it with a real nation-state with probable strategic capabilities after these last few public errors.

@Frabba Bolton is an idiot, yet my concern is that some kind of gaping vacuum of idiocy has opened up where the normal apparatus of empire goes beyond its usual naughtiness (which I often condemn on here, ex: Venezuela) and begun making a truly destructive mistake.

@Frabba Christ, I wish.

obviously i’ve been drinking as these tweets are incomprehensible bullshit, ha ha, nothing to see here, have a tilde: ~

anyway some of you may be taking busman’s holidays and see this, i dunno, but this is as best as i can tell a train wreck of the likes ive never seen in my lifetime and I say this from an ice-veined kissinger-esque perspective, this is a real state target not a former client

this is not a lefty post - more like hey it’s normal for us to do the realpolitik tango and yes it’s not just and a couple kk die and i dislike that very much for moral reasons but I’ve never felt my nonscientific and untestable spidey sense freak the fuck out like this before

not sure how to communicate this to any adults in the room in greenbelt / non-goslings but my intuition has been a long scream all day in the back of my head which has not stopped, this MENA shit is very bad, never had this bad-sense with our moves in 93/01/03+ re: sandbox

@RagnarRokh 24th, check forums for details, see you Sunday~

@ThierFournier i might try to eat all the foie gras in montreal, so 1. thanks for the invite 2. be careful what you wish for 3. thanks for the offer~

so we almost kicked off ww3 today, here’s a picture of a bunch of food, wretched excess provides a momentary distraction at least? also a cool car https://t.co/nMGqZ5JBia

perfectly normal things like eulogizing our war dead or coping with ubiquitous untreated ptsd or setting up medical fundraisers or worrying about fracking waste or lead or pesticides in the water or /fuck/

royal ascot was fun today, saw the sun, etc

Fucking hell.

you don’t really grok how much sheer slaughter and death is normal in our society, it’s like the background noise of our culture, until you’re away from that constant thrumming of conquest and murder and incarceration, slavery etc &amp; holy shit it’s a mindfuck when that noise stops

I mean yes brexit is dumb but fuck me it’s adorable and nice and I want to fucking hug it compared to ‘hey are we starting a new open war (compared to the secret wars) this week and how many of my friends may die or be mentally maimed from it’ or the daily mass shooting etc etc

you really don’t get a sense of what foreverwar and constant violence and preventable illness does to a society until you hang out in a place where it highlights that all this misery is, in fact, completely fucking optional; it Does Not Have To Be Like This. It simply doesn’t.

if you want a mindfuck while on vacay in the uk, ask the locals when they last went to war, when their last mass shooting was, how many vacation days they get a year + their next holiday plan, if their drinking water is clean, and how much they spend on medical shit each year

man with profile pic of himself sitting on bridge of half-billion dollar warship for lawls tweets existential question of his life being somehow more absurd because of monarchy and horses, perspective is meaningless, hypocrisy is inevitable, all is madness, time for bed

@Feiryred ugh this is funny in the abstract but the very idea makes me want to vomit

@Mynas @mapster_tacitus nope

@DunkDinkle a+++, the venison owned, kind of odd that the oysters came with the tops still on but that could just be an english thing (like the asparagus as finger food stuff), best in class cocktails, plus beer in real silver flagons, will be going back again

@UllerRM i didn’t even know this was a possibility, much less that one could do it in wretchedly posh circumstances, easily the highlight of the day unironically

saw the queen, smoked a cuban, stripped out of gentry cosplay and hit rules for dinner, learned that the english eat asparagus with their hands, and somehow no one is talking about the p3en purge, lawl~ https://t.co/GtCcwSB4Sj

until now I’ve mostly thought it only left me with a bad habit of ‘hunning’ people randomly, idk

also the Wire is basically a documentary speaking with the extremely flimsy authority of someone who lived there from 96 to 00

I’m in London atm, and went to college in Baltimore. I’d love to see a USA where mere stabbings are the worst we worry about. I went on a bender through London clubs in 2000 while still living in Baltimore, and when someone warned me about knife crime I laughed and laughed. https://t.co/r4DEnaIJ7x

@GoldOlmeca ok i give up have fun storming the castle and in a few years i look forward to your pro-gold-ammo csm run, as that's apparently what happens when i try to give people who seem smart but sheltered a peek behind the metagame curtain a chance to lose their naivete~

@GoldOlmeca ... you realize that even putting you on a no-vote slot would result in a bunch more gimmick votes going your way across the board due to social impact wait why the fuck am i even typing this sentence out holy crap this has become an alienation-inspired sunk cost fallacy thread

@GoldOlmeca like how the viceroy program was a total failure and then we rebranded it without telling anyone and altered the balance of bloc power for years to come, that was a good one we worked hard at and it's *crickets*

@GoldOlmeca we don't send randos to talk to ccp any more than we send a spook like me to lead a fleet

this is disappointing because you might have some very good reasons to loathe us ingame but i'd prefer you hate us for the things we're proud of being hateable at instead of tinfoil hooey

~in the game of empire you either hegemon or get hegemon'd~

as further evidence of applicability of macro-scale social dynamics in video games to real-world politics, i can't tell if this tweet is a brag about #eveonline or a despiring nihilistic commentary about our hellworld

@GoldOlmeca which is actually kinda frustrating because i legit watched and enjoyed your whaling vid, this kinda tinfoil 'i know what's really going on' lack of understanding-your-enemy indicates a similar lack of social praxis which is why i yoinked you from the 10th slot on our ballot

@GoldOlmeca yeah uh i'm not kidding at all, the assumption that i'm code-switching here betrays your lack of understanding of the purpose of our tribe and how our policies are designed, i have no reason to be shitty to you and my merely replying to you increases your chances of being elected

@GoldOlmeca that feeling when you're super lefty but you fucking love empire building and imperialism and it's just so much fucking fun as long as there's not actual blood on your hands or on your top hat~

@GoldOlmeca basically you have no idea what we're doing here with the Imperium but i applaud your investing tons of hours in stealing excavator drones to impact the MER by 2%, if you didn't exist we'd have to invent you to keep giving our officer corps constant training opportunities

@GoldOlmeca well i mean our diplo corps was literally created by a state department official, the Imperium is basically DARPA for imperialism and I'm not sure I'm being ironic about that at all, there's a reason why GSF is a magnet for the US military players and... yeah it's complicated

@HVACRepairman i used to think this too but I'm not sure 'regularly tops Cracked rosters of the biggest assholes in video games' is the disqualifier it was pre-2016

for those of you who follow me for psycho lefty politics and not space tyranny, the Imperium rallies more votes for our candidates in a /yearly/ election than most mid-size town mayors and reps in state and regional elections get and no one is better than us at it by now

it's fascinating and horrifying and lovely and where the fuck else besides #eveonline do you get to basically workshop applied politics without any pesky rules, regulations, or moral qualms getting in the way, and you get to do this every goddamned year

while i think a bunch of my real-world political knowhow comes from essentially prosecuting an enders game-style laboratory for modern imperialism over the past 14 years, holy shit do you learn a bunch about modern democracy by creating a party and running it in yearly elections

re: CSM elections in #eveonline is that at the top level of the meta there are exit polls, data archives, gimmicks and tons of methods to essentially create solidarity and a functional political party

then there's the 'i did an interview people will vote for me' beto-esque crowd

Is there an engineering nerd consensus on this shit or are we in the ‘platform wars’ stage still

So after Chernobyl, at first I was all ‘nuclear everything is awful’ and now I’m down a rabbit hole learning about how light water reactors suck compared to liquid salt or thorium and aaaa

if you made it to the end of this thread and are curious about the other pillar of the confederacy (the borderland culture), start here~ 

https://t.co/Wyh9Kvjgvu

while being fitted for my ludicrous royal ascot get-up, i was informed by my tailor that i possess a 'prominent seat', which is code for a 'big man ass'; not only do i like big butts, i am one~

on the struggle bus today trying to source an ascot-acceptable top hat while in freedomland, my problems have become completely alien and unrelatable even to myself

@ChrisWarcraft “It’s the Confederacy, stupid~”

this will be a thread for another day but domestic freedomland politics make a shitload more sense through the lens of international relations between adjacent and partially hostile nation-states, like western europe but way worse~

@pixelandthepen uh if you look at American history besides the civil war here and in Britain when you combine rationalist Yankee ingenuity with Cavalier officers and Borderland savagery and prowess you conquer the fucking world and put Rome itself to shame so no, I’d hardly call them losers

@Devilishlydo considering how many borderlander military types are in GSF (which has a disproportionate number of US mil players vs all other alliances) and I’m a cavalier asshole, there’s a useful lens here to understand #eveonline politics and warfare as well~

anyway I’m more fond of borderland culture perhaps because of spending my first ten years in Texas, my uncle has a cattle ranch, etc. there’s none of the snobbery you see in royalist cavalier bullshit land, as long as you’re kin and one of the tribe. If you ain’t though, git~

If Australia is full of British convicts, America is basically full of the biggest assholes the UK ever produced - that goes for Puritans, Cavaliers and the Borderlanders, our cultures are fucking psycho - perhaps the only ‘good guys’ are the poor Quakers

I’m personally against imperialism but modern politics is much more complicated when your recognize the possibility that the reason America is constantly at war is more of a feature than a bug, we’re more like four+ nations who hate each other masquerading as one country

Keep in mind that the Puritans and Cavaliers literally fought a civil war in England during the colonization of America and even the name ‘United States’ is kind of meta, the Constitution was essentially a peace treaty between Puritans, Quakers and Cavaliers to prevent more war

I grew up in cavalier culture and while folks had some guns it is nothing compared to the veritable arsenals my friends who have come from borderland culture enjoy - the modern south is a mix of these cultures, southern preppies, proud rednecks and of course oppressed black folk

anyway no shock here the warrior cultures of cavaliers (knights, horses) and the borderlands (infantry, guerrillas) are opposed to Puritan/Quaker impulses towards nonviolence and regulation of weapons

the candidates the borderlanders adore seem like absurd charlatans to the other three ‘murican cultures, here’s Andrew Jackson and you can draw your own Trump parallels https://t.co/kaHbYm8X0R

I want to read more about the Whiskey Rebellion because it’s basically about the other three nations in ‘murica crushing the borderlanders into submission because they are functionally left out of the constitutional process and holy shit it was fucking ugly https://t.co/hul9KZ5CFx

one shitty thing about this is the emotional and violent reaction to dissent/disagreement of any kind, if you disagree in this folkway you’re probably a filthy outsider who should be beaten the fuck up, disagreement is inherently a sign of treason p much https://t.co/Y0KJhENGt2

their conception of liberty amounts to ‘leave me and mine the fuck alone’ as unsurprisingly those raised on warfare between nobles aren’t too keen on government intervention in their lives and clan feuds https://t.co/b3ZtTMppyn

this is reflected in a court system that emphasizes punishing property crimes and handwaving personal violence since the clans will handle that on their own, so hey highest murder rates around, also fuck all cattle rustlers https://t.co/VqMJ25DZRt

If cavalier order and justice is based on maintaining royalist hierarchy, borderland order is straight out of Hammurabi - again, warrior culture and lex talionis https://t.co/fg9NksFQu2

unfortunately the warrior tribal honor code is highly gendered and so this is probably where a lot of the homophobia comes from https://t.co/ridybNcjzU

There is a bunch of cool shit about borderland culture that is Actually Pretty Awesome that gets overlooked, such as a genuine obsession with not lying (oral rather than written culture) and more equality of social behavior between economic classes https://t.co/4G3rNFJO3G

Here’s a thing about child-rearing and the violent and immediate defense of family/clan/derbfine honor, again warrior culture stuff https://t.co/tqnkMDhEgG

a theory is that all warrior cultures of this type show similar social structures, but this is also a cool excuse to show a screenshot about sex in the borderlands and not being prudish about it https://t.co/b1aDySimu4

@EVEbestofus Exactly, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing when properly understood in context

this isn’t to excuse those morals in the modern era but you gotta know how and why cultures tick if you want to make any sense of modern ‘Murcia especially if you come from a Puritan or Quaker culture based on punishing and abhorring violence and ‘ordered liberty’

Now keep in mind that from a structural perspective this is a consequence of the English nobility and the Scottish going to war for centuries and doing it on top of these folks, using them as shock troops. So they have a xenophobic and suspicious mindset which makes perfect sense

Oh yeah xenophobia and inherent conservatism and anti-intellectualism, let’s dive back into Albion’s Seed: https://t.co/avjz8WDbqc

ultimately though the cavaliers had a lot more in common with the borderlanders than the puritans and quakers - particularly on conceptions of warfare, role of govt, and gender roles. This developed over time into ‘north’ and ‘south’ but the internal cultures are v. different

The creation of the United States could be seen as a peace treaty between cavaliers, puritans and quakers; they left the borderlanders out of the deal and they immediately rebelled in the ‘whiskey rebellion’ which was glossed over in high school history class

this pissed off basically every other nation in colonial ‘Murcia - the borderlanders didn’t defer to the cavaliers or give a shit about their Anglican bullshit, and the puritans and quakers despises violence, but they fought against the natives and took the land no one wanted

despite being dirt starving poor and living in unimaginable poverty and horror they developed a tremendous pride perhaps because after generations of insecurity and no-holds-barred warfare they fucking love to fight and are damn good at it.

they came from the ‘borderlands’ between England and Scotland and before the migration spent centuries being the victims of constant raiding and vicious atrocity-filled warfare between those nations, always caught in the middle - men were warriors, women workers, and clan was key

The borderlanders came late to the ‘Murcia party and were mostly broke so they settled in the ‘rear’ of the colonies - Appalachia - and as inherently nomadic types they spread west into Texas, OK, but there were a fucking lot of them, outnumbering the other colonial migrations

your shitkickers, your ‘hicks’, your ‘aggies’, every shitty stereotype you may have about ‘hillbillies’ is probably dangerous and dumb, they are probably one of the core reasons why America is so fucking good at war and that’s not necessarily a bad thing from a coldhearted place

let’s explore the other pillar of the confederacy - the border/backcountry culture, forged by a thousand years of atrocity into a warrior society obsessed with tribal honor, violence, nascar, cowboys and patriarchy - the shock troops of modern ‘murican empire, allied w/cavaliers

There’s nothing at all hypocritical about Mitch McConnell seeking to stack the court with Confederate-friendly judges. Once you dispense with the naive idea that those who serve Dixie are looking out for the Union as a whole, everything clicks~

origins of foreverwar as a method of keeping freedomland together? https://t.co/R3U3sCZ47F

@Helleneste Patriarchy is at the core of both backcountry and cavalier gender roles, though raw homophobia may be a problem more in backcountry folkways because of the equation of traditional masculinity with warrior honor. Draft theory, not an expert, insert caveats here~

@marinakukso A fascinating lesson of Albion’s Seed (seriously everyone who liked this thread should read it asap) is how well it illustrates how meaningless word-labels like ‘liberty’ or ‘christian’ are, each folkway has radically different and oppositional meanings for liberty and religion

@TheRealMarxalot ‘his hate is pure’ may be the finest compliment I’ve ever received~

as a strategic guideline it's pointless to argue with or attempting to convert a confederate 'swing voter' or 'educate' them, the path to victory ~probably~ lies through expanding the franchise/fighting voter suppression @aoc primary style

tonight I'll be diving into the subtle differences between 'border/backcountry' xenophobia (fuck everyone not from here) vs cavalier (the lower orders should serve their betters) and how they get along peachy on patriarchy, as the cavalier/backcountry cultural alliance is key

hon hon hon https://t.co/NxoBRRgshm

@apartheid I was a lolbert until 2009 the it was all Adam Curtis docs to Marx to Chomsky and yeah I got over capitalism a decade ago, thank fuck but yeah, Eve clearly proves that shit doesn’t work as advertised

@apartheid I keep updating the pinned thread, this is the product of an ‘oh shit’ moment from May 15th and I’m still in the borderlands sections of Albion’s Seed, when I find shit I’ll post it here + spinning up a blog next

@apartheid Confidence, that I’ve got, don’t worry. This whole thing is the start of me making moves now that I see the pattern of the CSA and some potential fracture points.

Know that I despise the confederacy with a hatred even more personal than what I have for Band of Brothers~

@ThomasLindvall @shay_guy You’re a fool. 

For everyone else, arguing with Confederates and their apologists in good faith is a huge waste of time, that’s actually the whole point of their argumentative strategy. The ‘debate me’ shit is intended to divert you into a false frame and waste your energy~

@apartheid of course you’re right and any veteran director in Goonswarm has a more accurate understanding of operational politics than most career politicians in first world democracies soooo... we live in hell

@apartheid people unironically pointing to my political prowess in an Internet spaceship game as justification for why i should get involved in / have special abilities regarding politics is peak 2019

A relevant ‘The Confederacy Is Real’ post from before the Trump era; thanks to @shay_guy for linking it: 

https://t.co/n8bUOiQTQm

@shay_guy Excellent post, thanks for bringing it to my attention~

@joqatana Cavaliers are fine with a non-white underclass that outnumbers them, as long as they ‘know their place’ - working in the fields in high labor agrarian industries. They aren’t Nazis / eliminationist white supremacists. Standard rural patriarchy stuff, cotton won’t pick itself~

@MandyAnnWright my draft theory is that exposure of their aims - and people calling them confederates, questioning their loyalties in an uncomfortable turnabout from their usual tactic, might work. i’m mulling some ideas while doing more research, I’ll post here anything useful I scheme up

Note that the elites of both the US and the confederacy agree on empire, the monroe doctrine, etc, so here's a 2009 video of chomsky on the coup in honduras we supported and golly gee whiz why did that society collapse and suddenly everyone is fleeing???? https://t.co/OsMGLgH8dG

@zach_coffin Hey, cool - I graduated high school and fucked off to JHU in '96. It's such a weird, hidden society, and people the next neighborhood over have no idea what's lurking under that ancient tree cover. Thanks for saying something~

@ThomasLindvall like democracy or parties has a fucking thing to do with a monarchist culture that literally predates the colonization of america

these fucking people 

~cromwell was sherman before it was cool~

as someone will inevitably discover not EVERY street in Mountain Brook is named for civil war battles (there's a lot), the really old money lives on streets named for old british estates/towns + they're episcopalians (anglican 2.0) not baptists, of course

I'll develop all this crap into more useful tactics on the upcoming blog thing but this is all just-in-case 'yo guys, if I get hit by a bus, take Albion's Seed, drive through Mountain Brook for proof of everything I'm saying (crestline doesn't count lawl) go fight hydra'

as the DNC is incompetent one doesn't need to rely upon them, state by state in Dixie voting rights and organization must be pushed to undermine the structure of confederate power, that's the fracture point, that and forcing their true nature as confederates into the open

the lack of a concerted effort by the democratic party to win and develop victories in the south has allowed the bulwark of the RNC power to be unchallenged, if you erode the Dixie Wall in the Senate the republicans pretty much lose all their functional power

Not like they really hid that much, they had confederate flags flying over their capitols ever since the Civil War until recently, but the Union won the war and moved on, so folks think they’re fighting random bigots and not the CSA

Also by hiding and lying about the existence of Dixie, they fragment their opposition into issue-based groups - pro-choice, gun control, voters rights, anti-racism - instead of each opposition group recognizing that they are fighting the same confederate foe

And the cavalier conception of condescension and deference as two sides of God’s hierarchy and order is a fracture point, that’s why incivilility towards one’s ‘betters’ is so provocative - milkshakes would probably work over here, too

In case I get hit by a bus, I currently think the concept of hegemonic liberty is the most misunderstood aspect of the cavalier mindset, so here’s three key pages from Albion’s Seed~ https://t.co/2alLaSYAla

(they're way worse)

sure there’s a bunch of cruelty in there too but the whole thing is a means to the ends of rolling back the civil rights movement and restoring the structure of Dixie as the gentry/cavaliers prefer; the confederates may be slavers at heart but they’re not cartoon villains

by req: another ‘understanding the confederacy’ thing, all the protest tweets saying “the cruelty is the point” are wrong, the point is opportunities for race-based policing (a la weed), disenfranchisement, reinforcing patriarchy, and more labor/babies to exploit + compliance

@shilla oh alright ~fine~

@RaleighDSA Wonder if that tracks for each CSA capitol, and if a map for each could be turned into a useful poster or infographic - I don’t know but wouldn’t be shocked.

@RaleighDSA something about cavalier folkways and the confederacy still existing as a hydra-style not-really-hidden governmental entity goes here

It’s fascinating to watch the US corporate media apparatus launch into action on both Venezuela and Iran; it’s right out of Manufacturing Consent. Same shit, different decade~ https://t.co/yOazWTMso4

I don’t intend to reach a wide audience, this is for the handful of people whose ears perk up when I go off the deep end about sociology and psych while everyone else rolls their eyes and points out that I’m a pretentious windbag. Stuff for meta-political ur-nerds p much

I’m thinking about doing some longer-form writing about non-Eve topics - some of the weird pretentious crap I think about patterns of empire and hegemonic liberty and stuff too long to tweet. Question is platform - blog, email newsletter, some hybrid?

well look what turned up today~ https://t.co/cYxYAloOFB

@immolations shoot blues -&gt; tell vile rat

@carterforva Also thank fuck we have more (socialist) nerds in politics for moments like these~

@carterforva Cersei Steiner~

Took a nap after our first deployment op, ‘nap’ lasted six hours and now I’m waking up at midnight. 

This was not a master plan to alter my timezone coverage for spacewar purposes, either~

@carterforva Yo check out Albion’s Seed if you haven’t yet, there’s some... things in there.

“These patterns did not develop by chance. Virginia’s great migration was the product of policy and social planning. Its royalist elite succeeded in shaping the social history of an American region partly by regulating the process of migration” (p 232)

fucking hell it’s all here

Hey guess what turns out the control of women is deeply ingrained in cavalier society because uh... kidnapping / human trafficking / sexual slavery and a massively skewed male to female ratio

lovely people, these confederates https://t.co/seu0WBY0Fo

“It is difficult to think of any ruling elite that has been more closely interrelated since the Ptolemies” holy lawl (it is a history insult as he’s basically calling the cavaliers a nest of outright incest, the Ptolemaic dynasty was Targaryen-style sibling marriage) https://t.co/dY9SiHvteK

just gonna spend Friday night reading Albion’s seed to learn more fun ~cavalierfacts~ like how their royalist gentry is literally all one big interrelated family and coordinates retribution and uses debt to control the poor https://t.co/oZsGnkgNP9

@HendWex Precisely; it's the Confederacy. Wish that was a joke :/

look up how long jeff sessions family has been naming their kids after jefferson davis on his bio

dixie is real; it's the confederacy, the political moves the cavaliers and their overseers are making on behalf of the lost cause as plain as day if you know what to look for

oh yeah and Mitch McConnell was born and raised in Alabama and then Georgia from 8yrs on, so heyoooo

Amazing propaganda, excellent work~ https://t.co/mBCns4mNI8 #tweetfleet #eveonline

@MikeGravel It's the Confederacy~

@Fuzzysteve Precisely.

(they’re way worse)

sure there’s a bunch of cruelty in there too but the whole thing is a means to the ends of rolling back the civil rights movement and restoring the structure of Dixie as the gentry/cavaliers prefer; the confederates may be slavers at heart but they’re not cartoon villains

uh yeah another ‘understanding the confederacy’ thing, all the protest tweets saying “the cruelty is the point” are wrong, the point is opportunities for race-based policing (a la weed), disenfranchisement, reinforcing patriarchy, and more labor/babies to exploit + compliance

As a quick example of using the Lost Cause to understand Cavalier political behavior, Lindsey Graham's 'hypocrisy' makes perfect sense. He doesn't give a shit about spewing nonsense or lying to Yankees, all he cares about is Dixie. He's not dumb at all; the Union is his enemy.

on the one hand, it's kind of cool that this thread went over well; i was partially expecting a bunch of 'duh we already knew this' or 'you're wrong'

on the other hand aaaaaaaaaaaa this is not something i wanted my analysis to pass muster on aaaaa fuck god damn it

lawl turns out i went to the same elementary school as jeff bezos

https://t.co/EzVjMgg35j

None of this thread really applies to Texas. I was born in Houston, moved to AL at 10; completely different culture in Texas. Going to rodeos, oil/cattle, science, ranching. When I say the 'South' I'm talking about the plantation society of the Cavaliers.

@AbulurdBoniface er, class of land-owning gentry with lots of serfs/indentured servants/slaves, you know what i mean

@AbulurdBoniface It's not a matter of education. These are not simple run of the mill racists or nazis. This is a culture, functionally a nation, based on monarchism and having a class of land-owning serfs. The confederacy comes from the Cavaliers who got booted out after the English Civil War.

tl;dr "it's the confederacy, stupid"

also explains those crazy 'obama is the antichrist' memes; 

if you're a confederate, a black president existing is against everything your flavor of pro-slavery jesus stands for

you see this repeatedly through history where one side stops fighting after a victory and the other side loses but keeps trying to find ways to win, the Union torched the south and moved on, but the confederacy has /never stopped fighting/ using whatever means they have available

when LBJ shifted to supporting voting rights, the confederacy simply switched its support from the democrats to the republicans. it's a real thing and its moves make perfect sense once you grok the core motivations of the southern gentry and their henchmen~

Robert Caro basically spelled out in intricate detail how the confederacy works in his LBJ bios but particularly Master of the Senate, read these if you want a primer on actual power and its uses: https://t.co/DS5eHZKuUg

Pro-life? Confederacy. 
State's Rights? Confederacy. 
Gun rights? Confederacy. 
Religious Freedom/Gay Cake Stuff? Confederacy. 
Anti-union? Confederacy. 

If you're a Cavalier or one of their foremen, it all fits~

shit like Roy Moore being a pedo but coming within 1.7% of winning a senate seat makes a buttload more sense than 'alabama voters will send anything not a democrat', Moore is a proud and loud confederate and Doug Jones is anti-confederate

it's the confederacy - always.

ayyyyy this thread picked up a couple of nazis in the replies, guess I should open the floodgates and #AlabamaAbortionBan this sucker

the reality of the modern confederacy reminds me a lot of 'The City and the City' in that it's clearly visibile to those raised within it, yet its contour is completely alien to outsiders who don't know how to 'see' it the 'right' way.

conveniently the rest of america doesn't have much of an entrenched aristo/gentry culture anymore so the maneuvers of the 'neo' confederates just look like random right wing lashing out rather than a deliberate series of moves to benefit the southern aristocracy

anyhoo what i'm saying is that this isn't about random kooks trying to put women 'in their place' (there's a bunch of them too, useful idiots) but part of a broad campaign across generations by a disposessed cavalier nobility to get all their lost privileges (slavery) back

its not rocket science, you take a slaveholding landed gentry and take away their slaves and land (good!) that gentry is going to spend its time fanatically scheming to get its land and slaves back (bad, what we see in southern politics)

not that they have a problem with a death camp or three, it's difficult to communicate how utterly disposable the lives of people outside of their class are, this is a society whose rulers believe that god has annointed them to rule over their lessers

southern aristos are pro-life because the whole point of the society is the poor whites fight the poor blacks, and restricting abortion = more labor and poverty to exploit by the gentry

the goal of their flavor of white supremacy is about getting rich off slaves, not death camps

the civil war was only a few generations ago, these families have not forgotten and they have not let their children forget

the monuments, the street named for war battles, that's why it matters still to them

many old privileged families come with a legacy and a purpose imposed on you from birth

it's not a stretch of the imagination that the quest of a lot of these old aristo families is to restore the society to antebellum life and get their privileges (slavery) back

if they get away with the abortion thing, they'll gun for brown v board next; these people remember life before MLK and they have not forgotten or forgiven the civil rights movement

those behind this aren't hicks, they very smart confederates acting like hicks to fool you.

the whole 'the south will rise again' thing is a huge joke because the structure of the society immediately returned to functional slavery as soon as it could get away with it, the south already 'rose' after reconstruction, it's right in fucking the open

@TPoppaPuff hey, whats it like having tweeted 29,900 times but only have 299 followers?

generic usa high ~net worth individuals~ have nothing on the cunning and unity maintained by ancient proud cavalier aristocratic families in the south with shitloads of money who will do anything to protect the universe they and their forefathers have created (via slavery)

so basically you have an entrenched aristocracy that traces their lineage back 10+ generations running a plantation society and fighting like fucking hell to maintain that privilege, privilege most people in the usa cannot even begin to imagine

southern politics makes a lot more sense when viewed through the lens of pro/anti-confederacy politics; confederate society is based upon a ruling gentry descended from the cavaliers

see generally https://t.co/Y26JIDHALI 

actual /aristos/ not merely rich people

i kind of like the hyrda analogy for the neoconfederacy, because all this shit - 'states rights', 'pro-life', 'voter fraud', these disparate causes are actually all the same cause: 

the ~lost~ cause

guess i'm doing the whole bakunin arc now, welp vOv

the issue is not being part of a traitorous conspiracy against the united states government (i mean hydra, not the neoconfederacy, ha ha!) the problem comes when you state it where those not in on it can hear you. Viz: https://t.co/faHjKNKxpi

if you put 'hail hydra' on statues in every town in the region you don't have to bother saying 'hail hydra' or announce in print that you're down with hydra, everyone who lives there gets it

it's interesting to see the term neoconfederate finally get some use but it implies that there isn't already an actual working confederate states of america right in front of everyone's eyes that's been there since reconstruction, none of that shit is an accident

anyhoo yeah it's the same dance, play god-fearing jesus lover to keep the poor whites on your side, maintain that patriarchy with the complicity of ruling class women who enjoy the economic benefits of neoconfederacy, and live over the mountain so no one spots all the lexuses

'I'm the fucking Mittani, I know everything in this game,' another good one

wearing red shirts? stupid gimmick, keep doing it because it's a stupid gimmick, it's far better for our competitors/enemies to see me as a joke

luv2club? tee hee, flounce flounce, same shit

I mean to say, 'ha ha eat my ass look at me I'm so great at spaceship games', please interpret my above tweet as evidence of hubris and ignorance rather than giving up an actual tactic I've employed so often it's been nicknamed the 'tee hee, flounce flounce' by my chief of staff

it's almost comically effective, I do this stuff all the time in Eve - say laughably wrong things, act like a fool, and then it's much easier to outmaneuver people. The most dangerous enemy is one who is comfortable with being publicly underestimated.

southern aristos can be incredibly intelligent and well-travelled and are all the more dangerous politically because they are happy to play dumb in public with the aw-shucks jesus loving hick routine in order to quietly run an antebellum society and pit poor whites against blacks

folks have no clue how rich and well-educated the ruling class in alabama is, going to mountain brook means if you don't get into one of the better ivys you're probably a bitter slacker like me

legislation like this isn't from stupid hicks, it's the goal

for context, when i was in high school there were three country clubs, maybe 20k citizens, and zero black students; every street is named after a civil war battle, and 'houses' there would be called mansions anywhere else 

best public schools in the state though~

stating this openly might make me a class traitor but whatever i need to get fitted for a morning suit for the royal ascot next month, also eat my ass

source: i have been to an unironic country club debutante ball in dear old mountain brook and folks have no idea how much intergenerational wealth transfer has carried over from the days of slavery in that society's upper class

any '13th dimensional chess' tweets about how the AL leg composed this abortion ban to provoke a court fight has never met an actual neoconfederate

this is what they want 100%, it's a white supremacist aristo fertility cult and all the moves make sense when understood that way

if you ever wonder why i got politically 'radicalized' it's because i grew up in alabama as an athiest child of two biochemistry professors; at 17 i graduated and moved away forever. reminder: Alabama came within 1.7% of sending a known pedo to the senate~

Also this: https://t.co/dJBOSiVxnN for picking out some plants, god damn it, what the fuck

@UllerRM I fucking wish I could make this into an Eve joke :/

See generally this: https://t.co/LRoIfEOOBX

That moment when you buy a C02 detector, expecting that it'll show something low and all the hysteria about indoor c02 pollution affecting cognition won't be a real concern, and then first plug it in. With all your windows open. And get 457ppm. Time to buy houseplants. :/

Jamie leaving to go back to Cersei makes perfect sense if he is understood as a codependent trauma-bonded to his abuser; shit like that happens daily and gets people murdered by their abusers in the real world, yet 'why did he/she go back, so out of character' #gameofthrones

@AeornFlippout Might I recommend: https://t.co/sW6YBPaShg

@mcuban @KyleKulinski Did you get your talking points from Howard Schultz because this is utter gibberish

It’s like someone spliced an excellent anti-war drama about the horrors of aerial bombardment, imperialism, and the dangerous myth of heroic battle together with a crappy #GameofThrones episode

Don’t get me wrong, I’m kind of here for the heavy handed ‘Dragons are nuclear weapons, Targs are hypocritical colonizers, Kings Landing is Dresden, War Is Horrible’ stuff, but for some reason the Cersei is Hitler in the bunker stuff lost me.

I was expecting this GoT episode to be dodgy, but I didn’t expect them to crib so directly from the infamous scene in Downfall.

@GoldOlmeca @Doomchinchilla @GoonWave @Jibrishlol @JayAmazingness @KcolorCFC @CCP_Peligro @CCPGames @lugiathan eat my ass?

@GoldOlmeca @CCP_Peligro cool thread, one of several factors is that you may now please eat my ass

https://t.co/3s4X662UhX

7/ To everyone in the Casino war who wagged their fingers at us while proudly standing alongside NCdot and PL, your apology tour begins now. https://t.co/TMOmpMVL1F

6/ I have no intention of ever allowing anyone who accused GSF and the Imperium of being pro-botting or a haven of botting to live this evidence down; you can choke on your words and your hypocrisies. Eat dicks, assholes.

5/ Finally, I encourage all of the citizens of the Imperium to stand up for their innocence and demand apologies - or, when those apologies do not come, to proudly condemn and shame - everyone who has spent the past 10+ years falsely accusing us.

4/ Some will inevitably point out that the Imperium recently spun up a renter org; we have made no bones about the intention of our system: to dismantle and undercut the renter system of NC and PL, which is responsible for 16% of lifetime botting bans in #eveonline

3/ Some may argue that banning the practice of renting space in #eveonline is too much of an intervention in the gameplay itself, yet I believe it is necessary in the same way banning casinos was necessary. 

@CCP_Peligro's chart proves that botting is the product of renting.

2/ By contrast, Goonswarm's enemies - NC and PL's renters - are responsible for at ~16% of total lifetime bans for botting. 

If you really want to get rid of bots instead of simply smearing GSF and the Imperium, support the abolition of renting space by @CCPGames.

For years, my people have been accused of botting, harboring bots, cheating, and worse in #eveonline. Today evidence was revealed by @CCP_Peligro despite being the largest alliance in the game and in the gaming industry as a whole, GSF isn't even /on the chart/. #tweetfleet 1/

@CCP_Peligro @Canenald Ban renting space in the same way CCP banned casinos. Rented space is similarly toxic to the social fabric of the game, yet right now it’s part of the competitive fabric of null politics. It doesn’t have to be this way~

@benshapiro @willmenaker well that explains basically everything, k

@JosephCshnDavis I thought something was wrong with me because my heart was pounding so hard - seems I'm not the only one. I've never had a film of any kind hit me like that, ever.

Started watching #ChernobylHBO and found my heart racing and having serious anxiety, to the point that I thought I was having a panic attack. By far the most frightening 'horror' film I've encountered.

@ryangrim holy shit this

@tommyxtopher impressive pivot from ratio to corncob~

@mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 “The Gang Gets Ratioed”

@ToonyGoons ok i guess i've now caught up to shit everyone else figured out when these wankers first started popping up years ago, whee~

@ToonyGoons holy fuck it's actually about them being losers after all, but they're trying to redefine being a loser - it's not that i cry myself to sleep every night because of being chronically lame and desperately lonely, but because i'm a misunderstood hero

ok this fits - an incel thing.

@arospree they are all Lame As Hell? 

what does 'the real deal' mean, does it mean they own the libs? does it mean it's ok to be scared of girls because of 'superior logic' or some shit? 

seriously what is 'cool' about any of these guys idgi

@noizygamer imagine a jordan petersen fan repeatedly whispering to himself as he goes to bed (the bed is made ofc) each night 'i am part of the new counterculture, i am not Lame As Hell, i am so cool people just don't realize how cool i am' 

what a horrifically lonely nightmare life, fuck

@noizygamer yeah except actual counterculture fucks and parties

ex. the puritans were not counterculture they were psycho reactionaries

'clean your room' is as counterculture as 'read the bible' and 'obey your parents' and working for the heritage foundation

religious conservatives make perfect sense to me, intellectually - i disagree with everything about them but i 'get it'

it's the non-religious lamers looking up to losers like the 'intellectual dark web' absent any bible-banging that blows my fucking mind

@Mink_Car somewhere out there a turbochud is wishing that he can someday be as cool as tucker carlson or jordan pedersen. or hoping to get to hang out with them and ???? 

this has got to be a non-sexhaver or boring-sexhaver thing idgi

i don't mean the guys who are like 'yeah these dudes are wankers but they agree with my chud talking points', that makes sense in tribal terms

but the dudes who not only agree with these lamers but look up to them as role models, a la '30 minute politics youtube video guy #572'

disclaimer this isn't me trying to be edgy and funny, this is an Uncool Series of Tweets but i was really high and completely baffled by this, and still am unironically baffled the next day

@Mink_Car that's my question, if they were putting richard branson on a pedestal it would make sense as a 'capital aspirations + that dude is cool and knows how to party' thing from both an economic and a social aspiration motive

why would anyone aspire to be like jordan petersen

i recognize i'm super late to this party but is there a vast hidden demographic of turbo-losers who are so scared of sex that actually aspire to be more like these guys and emulate them

like 'oh yeah mike pence he's cool i'd love to hang out with him be scared of women together'

Had a mindfuck moment last night when thinking idly about how Carlson, Shapiro, Petersen, et al are lame as hell, then realizing that some people look up to them as cool and good

what sort of ultra-loser looks up to these wankers, is this a church thing, an incel thing, what

@oneevilchef @AynRandy so how does this work, after spamming my feed with shitty chud memes of racist shit, do you get to play the 'agree to disagree' card followed by calling yourself 'rational' and 'neutral' and decrying 'name calling' when your weakness is called out

asking for a friend~

@AynRandy it’s a delight, me casa su casa etc~

delighted to have finally caught a live chud in the replies

v. surprised to see those pesky millenials no longer being cool with death squads/war crimes after growing up having to cower behind desks during active shooter drills since they first went to school

please won't someone think of the neoliberal consensus :(((

@crushingbort @jaynordlinger holy /fuck/

The art in this article is absolutely stunning. I may write pretty words, but that's only because @Matterall373's work is so jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Couldn't have written it without his inspiration and guidance. https://t.co/LvKCPvXrWp #tweetfleet #eveonline
